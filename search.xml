Light and spicy hop character complements the malt. A dry beer with a firm body and smooth palate.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Malty and rich with grainy characteristics like baked bread or nutty, toasted bread crusts. Should not have darker roasted or chocolate notes. Malt intensity is moderate to moderately-high. Moderate to low hops complement but do not dominate the malt, and often have a spicy, peppery, or floral character. Fermentation character is very clean. Low to medium-low esters optional.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>The color ranges from amber to deep copper, stopping short of brown; bronze-orange is most common. Brilliant clarity. Thick, creamy, long-lasting off-white head.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Malt profile similar to the aroma, with an assertive, medium to high hop bitterness balancing the rich malty flavors. The beer finishes medium-dry to dry with a grainy, bitter, malty-rich aftertaste. The finish is long-lasting, sometimes with a nutty or bittersweet impression. The apparent bitterness level is sometimes masked by the malt character if the beer is not very dry, but the bitterness tends to scale with the malt richness to maintain balance. No roast. No harshness. Clean fermentation profile. Light fruity esters, especially dark fruit, may be present. Medium to low spicy, peppery, or floral hop flavor. Light minerally character optional.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium body. Smooth. Medium to medium-high carbonation. Astringency low to none.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Classic, traditional examples in the Altstadt (“old town”) section of Düsseldorf are served from casks. Most examples have a balanced (25-35 IBU) bitterness, not the aggressive hop character of the well-known Zum Uerige. Stronger sticke and doppelsticke beers should be entered in the 27 Historical Beer style instead.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Developed in the late 19th century in Düsseldorf to use lager techniques to compete with lager. Older German styles were brewed in the area but there is no linkage to modern Altbier.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Grists vary, but usually consist of German base malts (usually Pils, sometimes Munich) with small amounts of crystal, chocolate, or black malts. May include some wheat, including roasted wheat. Spalt hops are traditional, but other traditional German or Czech hops can be used. Clean, highly attenuative ale yeast. A step mash program is traditional. Fermented at cool ale temperatures, then cold conditioned.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>More bitter and malty than International Amber Lagers. Somewhat similar to California Common, both in production technique and finished flavor and color, though not in ingredients. Less alcohol, less malty richness, and more bitterness than a Dunkles Bock. Drier, richer, and more bitter than a Vienna Lager.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.044</td><td>1.052</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>1.008</td><td>1.014</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>25</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>9</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>4.3</td><td>5.5</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>Bolten Alt</li><li>Diebels Alt</li><li>Füchschen Alt</li><li>Original Schlüssel Alt</li><li>Schlösser Alt</li><li>Schumacher Alt</li><li>Uerige Altbier</li></ul><h2 id="Tags"><a href="#Tags" class="headerlink" title="Tags"></a>Tags</h2><ul><li>standard-strength</li><li>amber-color</li><li>top-fermented</li><li>lagered</li><li>central-europe</li><li>traditional-style</li><li>amber-ale-family</li><li>bitter</li></ul>]]></content>

The expected Märzen profile of toasty-rich malt, restrained bitterness, clean fermentation, and a relatively dry finish is enhanced by a noticeable to intense smoke character.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Blend of smoke and malt, varying in balance and intensity. The beechwood smoke character can range from subtle to fairly strong, and can seem smoky, woody, or bacon-like. The malt character can be low to moderate, and be somewhat rich, toasty, or malty-sweet. The malt and smoke components are often inversely proportional (i.e., when smoke increases, malt decreases, and vice versa). Low floral or spicy hop aroma optional. Clean fermentation profile.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Very clear, with a large, creamy, rich, tan- to cream-colored head.

Märzen-like qualities should be evident, particularly a malty, toasty richness, but the beechwood smoke flavor can be low to high. The palate can be somewhat malty, rich, and sweet, yet the finish tends to be medium-dry to dry with the smoke character sometimes enhancing the dryness of the finish. The aftertaste can reflect both malt richness and smoke flavors, with a balanced presentation desirable. Moderate, balanced, hop bitterness. Can have up to a moderate hop flavor with spicy, floral, or herbal notes. Clean lager fermentation character.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium body. Medium to medium-high carbonation. Smooth lager character. Significant astringent, phenolic harshness is inappropriate.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Literally smoke beer in German. The smoke character and intensity varies by maltster and brewery, so allow for variation in the style when judging – not all examples are highly smoked. Many other traditional German styles are smoked; those should be entered in the 32A Classic Style Smoked Beer style. This style is only for the more common Märzen-based beer.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>A historical specialty of the city of Bamberg, in the Franconian region of Bavaria in Germany. While smoked beers certainly were made long ago, the origins of this specific style are unclear but must have been developed after Märzen was created.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Märzen-type grist, with the addition of a sizeable quantity of German Rauchmalz (beechwood-smoked Vienna-type malt).

The overall malt impression is soft, elegant, and complex, with a rich malty aftertaste that is never cloying or heavy.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Moderate malty aroma, typically rich, bready, somewhat toasty, with light bread crust notes. Clean lager fermentation character. Very low floral, herbal, or spicy hop aroma optional. Caramel-sweet, biscuity-dry, or roasted malt aromas are inappropriate. Very light alcohol might be detected, but should never be sharp. Clean, elegant malt richness should be the primary aroma.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Amber-orange to deep reddish-copper color; should not be golden. Bright clarity, with persistent, off-white foam stand.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Moderate to high rich malt flavor often initially suggests sweetness, but the finish is moderately-dry to dry. Distinctive and complex maltiness often includes a bready, toasty aspect. Hop bitterness is moderate, and the floral, herbal, or spicy hop flavor is low to none. Hops provide sufficient balance that the malty palate and finish do not seem sweet. The aftertaste is malty, with the same elegant, rich malt flavors lingering. Noticeable sweet caramel, dry biscuit, or roasted flavors are inappropriate. Clean fermentation profile.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium body, with a smooth, creamy texture that often suggests a fuller mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. Fully attenuated, without a sweet or cloying impression. May be slightly warming, but the strength should be relatively hidden.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Modern domestic German Oktoberfest versions are golden – see the Festbier style for this version. Export German versions (to the United States, at least) are typically orange-amber in color, have a distinctive toasty malt character, and are often labeled Oktoberfest. Many craft versions of Oktoberfest are based on this style. Historic versions of the beer tended to be darker, towards the brown color range, but there have been many ‘shades’ of Märzen (when the name is used as a strength); this style description specifically refers to the stronger amber lager version. The modern Festbier can be thought of as a lighter-bodied, pale Märzen by these terms.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>As the name suggests, brewed as a stronger “March beer” in March and lagered in cold caves over the summer. Modern versions trace back to the lager developed by Spaten in 1841, contemporaneous to the development of Vienna lager. However, the Märzen name is much older than 1841 – the early ones were dark brown, and the name implied a strength band (14 °P) rather than a style. The amber lager style served at Oktoberfest from 1872 until 1990 when the golden Festbier was adopted as the standard festival beer.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Grist varies, although traditional German versions emphasized Munich malt. The notion of elegance is derived from the finest quality ingredients, particularly the base malts. A decoction mash is traditional, and enhances the rich malt profile.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Not as strong and rich as a Dunkles Bock. More malt depth and richness than a Festbier, with a heavier body and slightly less hops. Less hoppy but equally malty as a Czech Amber Lager, but with a different malt profile.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.054</td><td>1.060</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>1.010</td><td>1.014</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>18</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>8</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>5.6</td><td>6.3</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>Hacker-Pschorr Oktoberfest Märzen</li><li>Hofmark Märzen</li><li>Paulaner Oktoberfest</li><li>Saalfelder Ur-Saalfelder</li><li>Weltenburger Kloster Anno 1050</li></ul><h2 id="Tags"><a href="#Tags" class="headerlink" title="Tags"></a>Tags</h2><ul><li>standard-strength</li><li>amber-color</li><li>bottom-fermented</li><li>lagered</li><li>central-europe</li><li>traditional-style</li><li>amber-lager-family</li><li>malty</li></ul>]]></content>

The balance can vary quite a bit, with some versions being fairly malty and others being aggressively hoppy. Hoppy and bitter versions should not have clashing flavors with the caramel malt profile.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Low to moderate hop aroma reflective of American or New World hop varieties (citrus, floral, pine, resin, spice, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, or melon). A citrusy hop character is common, but not required. Moderately-low to moderately-high maltiness, usually with a moderate caramel character, that can either support, balance, or sometimes mask the hop presentation. Esters vary from moderate to none.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Deep amber to coppery-brown in color, sometimes with a reddish hue. Moderately large off-white head with good retention. Generally quite clear.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Moderate to high hop flavor with similar characteristics as the aroma. Malt flavors are moderate to strong, and usually show an initial malty sweetness followed by a moderate caramel flavor and sometimes toasty or biscuity malt flavors in lesser amounts. Dark or roasted malt flavors absent. Moderate to moderately-high bitterness. Balance can vary from somewhat malty to somewhat bitter. Fruity esters can be moderate to none. Caramel sweetness, hop flavor, and bitterness can linger somewhat into the medium to full yet dry finish.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium to medium-full body. Medium to high carbonation. Overall smooth finish without astringency. Stronger versions may have a slight alcohol warmth.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Can overlap in color with darker American pale ales, but with a different malt flavor and balance. A range of balance exists in this style, from balanced and malty to more aggressively hopped.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>A modern American craft beer style developed as a variation from American Pale Ales. Mendocino Red Tail Ale was first made in 1983, and was known regionally as a Red Ale. This served as the progenitor of Double Reds (American Strong Ale), Red IPAs, and other hoppy, caramelly beers.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Neutral pale ale malt.

The hop flavor and aroma complement and enhance the malt rather than clashing with it.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Moderate malty-sweet to malty-rich aroma with chocolate, caramel, nutty, or toasty qualities. Hop aroma is typically low to moderate, of almost any type that complements the malt. Some interpretations of the style may optionally feature a stronger hop aroma, an American or New World hop character (citrusy, fruity, tropical, etc.), or a dry-hopped aroma. Fruity esters are moderate to very low. The dark malt character is more robust than other brown ales, yet stops short of being overly Porter-like.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Light to very dark brown color. Clear. Low to moderate off-white to light tan head.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Medium to moderately-high malty-sweet or malty-rich flavor with chocolate, caramel, nutty, or toasty malt complexity, with medium to medium-high bitterness. Medium to medium-dry finish with an aftertaste of both malt and hops. Light to moderate hop flavor, sometimes citrusy, fruity, or tropical, although any hop flavor that complements the malt is acceptable. Very low to moderate fruity esters. The malt and hops are generally equal in intensity, but the balance can vary in either direction. Should not have a roasted character suggestive of a Porter or Stout.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium to medium-full body. More bitter versions may have a dry, resiny impression. Moderate to moderately-high carbonation. Stronger versions may be lightly warming.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Most commercial American Browns are not as aggressive as the original homebrewed versions, and some modern craft-brewed examples. This style reflects the current commercial offerings typically marketed as American Brown Ales rather than the hoppier, stronger homebrew versions from the early days of homebrewing. These IPA-strength brown ales should be entered as 21B Specialty IPA: Brown IPA.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>An American style from the early modern craft beer era. Derived from English Brown Ales, but with more hops. Pete’s Wicked Ale (1986) defined the style, which was first judged at the Great American Beer Festival in 1992.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Pale malt, plus crystal and darker malts (typically chocolate). American hops are typical, but continental or New World hops can also be used.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>More chocolate and caramel flavors than American Pale or Amber Ales, typically with less prominent bitterness in the balance. Less bitterness, alcohol, and hop character than Brown IPAs.

Smooth and well carbonated.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Moderate to high herbal, resinous, floral, or minty hops. Light fruitiness acceptable. Low to moderate caramel or toasty malt supports the hops.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Medium amber to light copper color. Generally clear. Moderate off-white head with good retention.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Moderately malty with a pronounced hop bitterness. The malt character usually has toast (not roast) and caramel flavors. Low to moderately high hop flavor, usually showing rustic, traditional American hop qualities (often herbal, resinous, floral, minty). Finish fairly dry and crisp, with a lingering hop bitterness and a firm, grainy malt flavor. Light fruity esters are acceptable, but otherwise clean.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium-bodied. Medium to medium-high carbonation.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>This style is narrowly defined around the prototypical Anchor Steam example, although allowing other typical ingredients of the era. Northern Brewer hops are not a strict requirement for the style. Modern American and New World-type hops (especially citrusy ones) are inappropriate.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>American West Coast original, brewed originally as Steam Beer during the Gold Rush era. Large shallow open fermenters (coolships) were used to compensate for the lack of refrigeration and to take advantage of the cool temperatures in the San Francisco Bay area. Modern versions are based on Anchor Brewing re-launching the style in the 1970s.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Pale ale malt, non-citrusy hops (often Northern Brewer), small amounts of toasted malt or crystal malts. Lager yeast; however, some strains (often with the mention of “California” in the name) work better than others at the warmer fermentation temperatures (55 to 60 °F) typically used. Note that some German yeast strains produce inappropriate sulfury character.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Superficially similar to an American Amber Ale, but with specific choices for malt and hopping – the hop flavor and aroma is traditional (not modern) American hops, malt flavors are toastier, the hopping is always assertive, and a warm-fermented lager yeast is used. Less attenuated, less carbonated and less fruity than Australian Sparkling ale.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.048</td><td>1.054</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>1.011</td><td>1.014</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>30</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>9</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>4.5</td><td>5.5</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>Anchor Steam</li><li>Steamworks Steam Engine Lager</li></ul><h2 id="Tags"><a href="#Tags" class="headerlink" title="Tags"></a>Tags</h2><ul><li>standard-strength</li><li>amber-color</li><li>bottom-fermented</li><li>north-america</li><li>traditional-style</li><li>amber-lager-family</li><li>bitter</li><li>hoppy</li></ul>]]></content>

Roasty-burnt malt with a depth of dark or dried fruit flavors, and a warming, bittersweet finish. Despite the intense flavors, the components need to meld together to create a complex, harmonious beer, not a hot mess – sometimes only accomplished with age.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Rich, deep, complex, and often quite intense, with a pleasant blend of roast, fruit, hops, and alcohol. Light to moderately strong roast can have a coffee, bittersweet or dark chocolate, cocoa, black licorice, tar, or slightly burnt grain quality, sometimes with a light caramel sweetness or toasty maltiness. Low to moderately strong esters often perceived as dark or dried fruits like plums, prunes, figs, black currants, or raisins. Very low to fairly aggressive hops, often English or American in character. Alcohol flavor optional, but should not be sharp, hot, or solventy. The balance between these main four components can vary greatly; not all need to be noticeable, but those present should have a smooth interplay. Age can add another dimension, including a vinous or port-like impression, but not sourness. Age can decrease aroma intensity.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Color ranges from very dark reddish-brown to jet black. Opaque. Deep tan to dark brown head. Generally has a well-formed head, although head retention may be low to moderate. High alcohol and viscosity may be visible as legs.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Like the aroma, a complex mix of roast, fruit, hops, and alcohol (same descriptors apply). The flavors can be quite intense, often greater than in the aroma, but the same warning about the balance varying greatly still applies. Medium to aggressively high bitterness. The maltiness balances and supports the other flavors, and may have qualities of bread, toast, or caramel. The palate and finish can be fairly dry to moderately sweet, an impression that often changes with age. Should not by syrupy or cloying. Aftertaste of roast, bitterness, and warmth. Same age effects as in the aroma apply.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Full to very full-bodied and chewy, with a velvety, luscious texture. The body and texture may decline with age. Gentle, smooth warmth should be present and noticeable, but as a background character. Low to moderate carbonation.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Sometimes known as Russian Imperial Stout or RIS. Varying interpretations exist with American versions having greater bitterness, and more roasted character and late hops, while English varieties often reflect a more complex specialty malt character with a more forward ester profile. Not all Imperial Stouts have a clearly ‘English’ or ‘American’ character; anything in between is allowable as well, which is why it is counter-productive to define strict sub-types. Judges must be aware of the broad range of the style, and not try to judge all examples as clones of a specific commercial beer.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>A style with a long, although not necessarily continuous, heritage. Traces roots to strong English porters brewed for export in the 1700s, and said to have been popular with the Russian Imperial Court. After the Napoleonic wars interrupted trade, these beers were increasingly sold in England. The style eventually all but died out, until being popularly embraced in the modern craft beer era in England as a revival export and in the United States as an adaptation by extending the style with American characteristics.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Pale malt with significant roasted malts or grain. Flaked adjuncts common. American or English ale yeast and hops are typical. Ages very well. Increasingly used as the base beer for many specialty styles.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Darker and more roasty than Barleywines, but with similar alcohol. More complex, with a broader range of possible flavors, than lower-gravity stouts.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.075</td><td>1.115</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>1.018</td><td>1.030</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>50</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>30</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>8.0</td><td>12.0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>American – Bell’s Expedition Stout</li><li>Great Divide Yeti Imperial Stout</li><li>North Coast Old Rasputin Imperial Stout</li><li>Oskar Blues Ten Fidy</li><li>Sierra Nevada Narwhal Imperial Stout; English – 2SP Brewing Co The Russian</li><li>Courage Imperial Russian Stout</li><li>Le Coq Imperial Extra Double Stout</li><li>Samuel Smith Imperial Stout</li><li>Thornbridge Saint Petersburg</li></ul><h2 id="Tags"><a href="#Tags" class="headerlink" title="Tags"></a>Tags</h2><ul><li>very-high-strength</li><li>dark-color</li><li>top-fermented</li><li>british-isles</li><li>north-america</li><li>traditional-style</li><li>craft-style</li><li>stout-family</li><li>malty</li><li>bitter</li><li>roasty</li></ul>]]></content>

However, the word Wild does not imply that these beers are necessarily spontaneously-fermented; rather, it indicates that they are influenced by microbes other than traditional brewer’s yeasts, or perhaps that they are mixed-fermentation beers.

Look for an agreeable balance between the base beer and the fermentation character. A range of results is possible from fairly high acidity and funk to a subtle, pleasant, harmonious beer. The best examples are pleasurable to drink with the esters and phenols complementing the malt or hops. The wild character can be prominent, but does not need to be dominating in a style with an otherwise strong malt or hop profile. Acidity should be firm yet enjoyable, and ranging from clean to complex, but should not be biting or vinegary; prominent, objectionable, or offensive acetic acid is a fault. Bitterness tends to be low, especially as sourness increases.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Variable by base style.

The copper-colored beer lacks the aggressive yeast character or sourness of many Belgian beers, but has a well-balanced, malty, fruity, and often bready and toasty profile.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Moderate bready malt aroma, which can include toasty, biscuity, or nutty notes, possibly with a touch of light caramel or honey. Moderate to moderately high fruitiness complements the malt, and is suggestive of pear, orange, apple, or lemon, and sometimes of darker stone fruit like plums. Low to moderate spicy, herbal, or floral hop character. Low peppery, spicy phenols optional. The hop character is lower in balance than the malt and fruitiness.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Amber to copper in color.

Well carbonated.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Has an initial soft, smooth, moderately malty flavor with a variable profile of toasty, biscuity, nutty, light caramel, or honey notes. Moderate to moderately high fruitiness, with a pear, orange, apple, or lemon character. Medium-low to low spicy, herbal, or floral hop character. Medium-high to medium-low bitterness, enhanced by optional low to very low peppery phenols. Dry to balanced finish, with hops becoming more pronounced in the aftertaste of those with a drier finish. Fairly well balanced overall, with no single component being high in intensity; malt and fruitiness are more forward initially with a supportive bitterness and drying character coming on late.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium to medium-light body. Smooth palate. Alcohol level is restrained, and any warming character should be low if present.

The use of crystal malts in bitters became more widespread after WWI. Traditionally served very fresh under no pressure (gravity or hand pump only) at cellar temperatures (i.e., “real ale”). Most bottled or kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are often higher-alcohol and more highly carbonated versions of cask products produced for export, and have a different character and balance than their draught counterparts in Britain (often being sweeter and less hoppy than the cask versions). These guidelines reflect the “real ale” version of the style, not the export formulations of commercial products.<br>Several regional variations of bitter exist, ranging from darker, sweeter versions served with nearly no head to brighter, hoppier, paler versions with large foam stands, and everything in between.<br>Judges should not over-emphasize the caramel component of these styles. Exported bitters can be oxidized, which increases caramel-like flavors (as well as more negative flavors). Do not assume that oxidation-derived flavors are traditional or required for the style. *</p><h2 id="Guidelines"><a href="#Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines"></a>Guidelines</h2><h3 id="Impression"><a href="#Impression" class="headerlink" title="Impression"></a>Impression</h3><p>Low gravity, alcohol, and carbonation make this an easy-drinking session beer. The malt profile can vary in flavor and intensity, but should never override the overall bitter impression. Drinkability is a critical component of the style.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Low to moderate malt aroma, often (but not always) with a light caramel quality. Bready, biscuity, or lightly toasty malt complexity is common. Mild to moderate fruitiness. Hop aroma can range from moderate to none, typically with a floral, earthy, resiny, or fruity character. Generally no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Pale amber to light copper color. Good to brilliant clarity. Low to moderate white to off-white head. May have very little head due to low carbonation.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Medium to moderately high bitterness. Moderately low to moderately high fruity esters. Moderate to low hop flavor, typically with an earthy, resiny, fruity, or floral character. Low to medium maltiness with a dry finish. The malt profile is typically bready, biscuity, or lightly toasty. Low to moderate caramel or toffee flavors are optional. Balance is often decidedly bitter, although the bitterness should not completely overpower the malt flavor, esters, and hop flavor. Generally no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Light to medium-light body. Low carbonation, although bottled examples can have moderate carbonation.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>The lowest gravity member of the British Bitter family, typically known to consumers simply as “bitter” (although brewers tend to refer to it as Ordinary Bitter to distinguish it from other members of the family).</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>See comments in category introduction.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Pale ale, amber, or crystal malts. May use a touch of dark malt for color adjustment. May use sugar adjuncts, corn, or wheat.

Characterful British yeast.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Some modern variants are brewed exclusively with pale malt and are known as golden ales, summer ales, or golden bitters.

A delicate, lightly spiced, moderate-strength ale that is a refreshing summer drink with its high carbonation, dry finish, and light hopping.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Moderate bready maltiness, often with light notes of honey or vanilla. Light grainy, spicy wheat aromatics. Moderate perfumy-lemony coriander, often with a complex herbal, spicy, or peppery note in the background. Moderate zesty, citrusy-orangey fruitiness. A low spicy-herbal hop aroma is optional, but typically absent. Spices should blend in with fruity, floral, and sweet aromas and should not be overly strong.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Very pale straw to deep yellow in color. The beer will be very cloudy from starch haze or yeast, which gives it a milky, whitish-yellow shine. Dense, white, moussy head.

A spicy-earthy hop flavor can be low to none, and never overshadows the spices. Hop bitterness is low to medium-low, and supports the refreshing flavors of fruit and spice.

Spicing has some variety, but should not be overdone. Coriander of certain origin or age might give an inappropriate ham or celery character. The beer tends to be perishable, so younger, fresher, properly-handled examples are most desirable. An impression of sweetness is often due to low bitterness, not residual sugar.

The use of crystal malts in bitters became more widespread after WWI. Traditionally served very fresh under no pressure (gravity or hand pump only) at cellar temperatures (i.e., “real ale”). Most bottled or kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are often higher-alcohol and more highly carbonated versions of cask products produced for export, and have a different character and balance than their draught counterparts in Britain (often being sweeter and less hoppy than the cask versions). These guidelines reflect the “real ale” version of the style, not the export formulations of commercial products.<br>Several regional variations of bitter exist, ranging from darker, sweeter versions served with nearly no head to brighter, hoppier, paler versions with large foam stands, and everything in between.<br>Judges should not over-emphasize the caramel component of these styles. Exported bitters can be oxidized, which increases caramel-like flavors (as well as more negative flavors). Do not assume that oxidation-derived flavors are traditional or required for the style. *</p><h2 id="Guidelines"><a href="#Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines"></a>Guidelines</h2><h3 id="Impression"><a href="#Impression" class="headerlink" title="Impression"></a>Impression</h3><p>A flavorful, yet refreshing, session beer. Some examples can be more malt balanced, but this should not override the overall bitter impression. Drinkability is a critical component of the style.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Low to moderate malt aroma, often (but not always) with a low to medium-low caramel quality. Bready, biscuit, or lightly toasty malt complexity is common. Mild to moderate fruitiness. Hop aroma can range from moderate to none, typically with a floral, earthy, resiny, or fruity character. Generally no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Pale amber to medium copper color.

Refreshing, yet flavorful for its strength, with a wide range of dark malt or dark sugar expression.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Low to moderate malt aroma, and may have some fruitiness. The malt expression can take on a wide range of character, which can include caramel, toffee, grainy, toasted, nutty, chocolate, or lightly roasted. Low earthy or floral hop aroma optional. Very low diacetyl optional.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Copper to dark brown or mahogany color.

Can finish sweet to dry. Versions with darker malts may have a dry, roasted finish. Low to moderate bitterness, enough to provide some balance but not enough to overpower the malt in the balance. Moderate fruity esters optional. Low hop flavor optional. Low diacetyl optional.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Light to medium body. Generally low to medium-low carbonation. Roast-based versions may have a light astringency. Sweeter versions may seem to have a rather full mouthfeel for the gravity. Should not be flat, watery, or thin.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Most are low-gravity session beers around 3.2%, although some versions may be made in the stronger (4%+) range for export, festivals, seasonal or special occasions. Generally served on cask; session-strength bottled versions don’t often travel well. A wide range of interpretations are possible. Pale (medium amber to light brown) versions exist, but these are even more rare than dark milds; these guidelines only describe the modern dark version.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Historically, ‘mild’ was simply an unaged beer, and could be used as an adjective to distinguish between aged or more highly hopped keeping beers. Modern milds trace their roots to the weaker X-type ales of the 1800s, which started to get darker in the 1880s, but only after WWI did they become dark brown. In current usage, the term implies a lower-strength beer with less hop bitterness than bitters. The guidelines describe the modern British version. The term ‘mild’ is currently somewhat out of favor with consumers, and many breweries no longer use it. Increasingly rare. There is no historic connection or relationship between Mild and Porter.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Pale British base malts (often fairly dextrinous), crystal malt, dark malts or dark sugar adjuncts, may also include adjuncts such as flaked maize, and may be colored with brewer’s caramel. Characterful British ale yeast. Any type of hops, since their character is muted and rarely is noticeable.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Some versions may seem like lower-gravity modern English Porters.

A stronger Double Brown Ale was more popular in the past, but is very hard to find now.

Modern craft examples in the UK are bigger and hoppier.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Originating in London in the early 1700s, porter evolved as a more heavily hopped and aged (keeping) version of the Brown Beer popular at the time. It evolved many times based on various technological and ingredient developments (such as the invention of black malt in 1817, and large-scale industrial brewing), as well as consumer preferences, wars, and tax policy. It became a highly-popular, widely-exported style in the early 1800s before declining by the 1870s as it changed to a lower gravity, unaged beer. As gravities continued to decline in all UK beers in the first half of the 1900s, styles stopped being made (including porter, gone by the 1950s). The craft beer era led to its re-introduction in 1978.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Grists vary, but something producing a dark color is always involved.

The use of crystal malts in bitters became more widespread after WWI. Traditionally served very fresh under no pressure (gravity or hand pump only) at cellar temperatures (i.e., “real ale”). Most bottled or kegged versions of UK-produced bitters are often higher-alcohol and more highly carbonated versions of cask products produced for export, and have a different character and balance than their draught counterparts in Britain (often being sweeter and less hoppy than the cask versions). These guidelines reflect the “real ale” version of the style, not the export formulations of commercial products.<br>Several regional variations of bitter exist, ranging from darker, sweeter versions served with nearly no head to brighter, hoppier, paler versions with large foam stands, and everything in between.<br>Judges should not over-emphasize the caramel component of these styles. Exported bitters can be oxidized, which increases caramel-like flavors (as well as more negative flavors). Do not assume that oxidation-derived flavors are traditional or required for the style. *</p><h2 id="Guidelines"><a href="#Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines"></a>Guidelines</h2><h3 id="Impression"><a href="#Impression" class="headerlink" title="Impression"></a>Impression</h3><p>An average-strength to moderately-strong British bitter ale. The balance may vary between fairly even between malt and hops to somewhat bitter. Drinkability is a critical component of the style. A rather broad style that allows for considerable interpretation by the brewer.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Hop aroma moderately-high to moderately-low, typically with a floral, earthy, resiny, or fruity character. Medium to medium-high malt aroma, optionally with a low to moderate caramel component. Medium-low to medium-high fruity esters. Generally no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Light amber to deep copper color. Good to brilliant clarity. Low to moderate white to off-white head. A low head is acceptable when carbonation is also low.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Medium to medium-high bitterness with supporting malt flavors evident. The malt profile is typically bready, biscuity, nutty, or lightly toasty, and optionally has a moderately low to moderate caramel or toffee flavor. Hop flavor moderate to moderately high, typically with a floral, earthy, resiny, or fruity character. Hop bitterness and flavor should be noticeable, but should not totally dominate malt flavors. Moderately-low to high fruity esters. Optionally may have low amounts of alcohol. Medium-dry to dry finish. Generally no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium-light to medium-full body. Low to moderate carbonation, although bottled versions will be higher. Stronger versions may have a slight alcohol warmth but this character should not be too high.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>In England today, “ESB” is a Fullers trademark, and no one thinks of it as a generic class of beer. It is a unique (but very well-known) beer that has a very strong, complex malt profile not found in other examples, often leading judges to overly penalize traditional English strong bitters. In America, ESB has been co-opted to describe a malty, bitter, reddish, standard-strength (for the US) British-type ale, and is a popular craft beer style. This may cause some judges to think of US brewpub ESBs as representative of this style.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>See comments in category introduction. Strong bitters can be seen as a higher-gravity version of best bitters (although not necessarily “more premium” since best bitters are traditionally the brewer’s finest product). British pale ales are generally considered a premium, export-strength pale, bitter beer that roughly approximates a strong bitter, although reformulated for bottling (including increasing carbonation levels). While modern British pale ale is considered a bottled bitter, historically the styles were different.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Pale ale, amber, or crystal malts, may use a touch of black malt for color adjustment. May use sugar adjuncts, corn or wheat. English finishing hops are most traditional, but any hops are fair game; if American hops are used, a light touch is required. Characterful British yeast. Burton versions use medium to high sulfate water, which can increase the perception of dryness and add a minerally or sulfury aroma and flavor.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>More evident malt and hop flavors than in a special or best bitter, as well as more alcohol. Stronger versions may overlap somewhat with British Strong Ales, although Strong Bitters will tend to be paler and more bitter. More malt flavor (particularly caramel) and esters than an American Pale Ale, with different finishing hop character.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.048</td><td>1.060</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>1.010</td><td>1.016</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>30</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>8</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>4.6</td><td>6.2</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>Bass Ale</li><li>Bateman’s Triple XB</li><li>Robinsons Trooper</li><li>Samuel Smith’s Organic Pale Ale</li><li>Shepherd Neame Bishop’s Finger</li><li>Summit Extra Pale Ale</li></ul><h2 id="Tags"><a href="#Tags" class="headerlink" title="Tags"></a>Tags</h2><ul><li>standard-strength</li><li>amber-color</li><li>top-fermented</li><li>british-isles</li><li>traditional-style</li><li>amber-ale-family</li><li>bitter</li></ul>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Czech-Lager-Czech-Dark-Lager"><a href="#Czech-Lager-Czech-Dark-Lager" class="headerlink" title="Czech Lager - Czech Dark Lager"></a>Czech Lager - Czech Dark Lager</h1><h2 id="Name"><a href="#Name" class="headerlink" title="Name"></a>Name</h2><p>Czech Dark Lager</p><h2 id="Category"><a href="#Category" class="headerlink" title="Category"></a>Category</h2><p>Czech Lager</p><p><em>Czech lagers are generally divided by gravity class (draft, lager, special) and color (pale, amber, dark). The Czech names for these categories are světlé (pale), polotmavé (amber), and tmavé (dark). The gravity classes are výčepní (draft, 7–10 °P), ležák (lager, 11–12 °P), and speciální (special, 13 °P+). Pivo is of course the Czech word for beer. The division into gravity classes is similar to the German groupings of schankbier, vollbier, and starkbier, although at different gravity ranges. Czech beers within the classes are often simply referenced by their gravity. There are often variations within the gravity-color groupings, particularly within the speciální class. The style guidelines combine some of these classes, while other beers in the Czech market are not described (such as the strong Czech Porter). This is not to imply that the categories below are the full coverage of Czech beers, simply a way of grouping some of the more commonly found types for judging purposes.<br>Czech lagers in general are differentiated from German and other Western lagers in that German lagers are almost always fully attenuated, while Czech lagers can have a slight amount of unfermented extract remaining in the finished beer. This helps provide a slightly higher finishing gravity (and thus slightly lower apparent attenuation), slightly fuller body and mouthfeel, and a richer, slightly more complex flavor profile in equivalent color and strength beers. German lagers tend to have a cleaner fermentation profile, while Czech lagers are often fermented cooler (7–10 °C) and for a longer time, and can have a light, barely noticeable (near threshold) amount of diacetyl that often is perceived more as a rounded body than overtly in aroma and flavor [significant buttery diacetyl is a flaw]. Czech lager yeast strains are not always as clean and attenuative as German strains, which helps achieve the higher finishing gravity (along with the mashing methods and cooler fermentation). Czech lagers are traditionally made with decoction mashes (often double decoction), even with modern malts, while most modern German lagers are made with infusion or step infusion mashes. These differences characterize the richness, mouthfeel, and flavor profile that distinguishes Czech lagers.</em></p><h2 id="Guidelines"><a href="#Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines"></a>Guidelines</h2><h3 id="Impression"><a href="#Impression" class="headerlink" title="Impression"></a>Impression</h3><p>A rich, dark, malty Czech lager with a roast character that can vary from almost absent to quite prominent.

Moderate to medium-low bitterness, but should be perceptible. Balance can vary from malty to relatively well-balanced to gently hop-forward.

This is not to imply that the categories below are the full coverage of Czech beers, simply a way of grouping some of the more commonly found types for judging purposes.<br>Czech lagers in general are differentiated from German and other Western lagers in that German lagers are almost always fully attenuated, while Czech lagers can have a slight amount of unfermented extract remaining in the finished beer. This helps provide a slightly higher finishing gravity (and thus slightly lower apparent attenuation), slightly fuller body and mouthfeel, and a richer, slightly more complex flavor profile in equivalent color and strength beers. German lagers tend to have a cleaner fermentation profile, while Czech lagers are often fermented cooler (7–10 °C) and for a longer time, and can have a light, barely noticeable (near threshold) amount of diacetyl that often is perceived more as a rounded body than overtly in aroma and flavor [significant buttery diacetyl is a flaw]. Czech lager yeast strains are not always as clean and attenuative as German strains, which helps achieve the higher finishing gravity (along with the mashing methods and cooler fermentation). Czech lagers are traditionally made with decoction mashes (often double decoction), even with modern malts, while most modern German lagers are made with infusion or step infusion mashes. These differences characterize the richness, mouthfeel, and flavor profile that distinguishes Czech lagers.</em></p><h2 id="Guidelines"><a href="#Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines"></a>Guidelines</h2><h3 id="Impression"><a href="#Impression" class="headerlink" title="Impression"></a>Impression</h3><p>A lighter-bodied, rich, refreshing, hoppy, bitter pale Czech lager having the familiar flavors of the stronger Czech Premium Pale Lager (Pilsner-type) beer but in a lower alcohol, lighter-bodied, and slightly less intense format.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Light to moderate bready-rich malt combined with light to moderate spicy or herbal hop bouquet; the balance between the malt and hops may vary.

The Czech names for these categories are světlé (pale), polotmavé (amber), and tmavé (dark). The gravity classes are výčepní (draft, 7–10 °P), ležák (lager, 11–12 °P), and speciální (special, 13 °P+). Pivo is of course the Czech word for beer. The division into gravity classes is similar to the German groupings of schankbier, vollbier, and starkbier, although at different gravity ranges. Czech beers within the classes are often simply referenced by their gravity. There are often variations within the gravity-color groupings, particularly within the speciální class. The style guidelines combine some of these classes, while other beers in the Czech market are not described (such as the strong Czech Porter).

Malt and hop flavors are medium to medium-high, and the malt may contain a slight impression of caramel. Bitterness is prominent but never harsh. The long finish can be balanced towards hops or malt but is never aggressively tilted either way.

This style is a combination of the Czech styles světlý ležák (11–12.9 °P) and světlé speciální pivo (13–14.9 °P). In the Czech Republic, only Pilsner Urquell and Gambrinus are called Pilsner, despite how widely adopted this name is worldwide.

Restrained bitterness, medium-low to medium, giving an overall malty balance. Malty and soft on the palate without being overly sweet, and medium-dry in the finish with a malty aftertaste. No roast, burnt, or bitter malt flavors, toasted flavors shouldn’t have a harsh grainy dryness, and caramel flavors should not be sweet. Low spicy, herbal, or floral hop flavor optional.

An original Scottish version used a significant amount of oat malt. Later went through a shady phase where some English brewers would throw a handful of oats into their parti-gyled stouts in order to legally produce a ‘healthy’ Oatmeal Stout for marketing purposes. Most popular in England between the World Wars, was revived in the craft beer era for export, which helped lead to its adoption as a popular modern American craft beer style that uses a noticeable (not symbolic) quantity of oats.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Pale, caramel, and dark roasted malts (often chocolate) and grains.

The lighter body, dryness, and lack of a harsh, burnt, or heavy aftertaste helps make this beer quite drinkable.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Low to moderate malt, with low aromatic malty sweetness and hints of roast malt often apparent. The malt can be clean and neutral or moderately rich and bready, and may have a hint of dark caramel. The roast character can be somewhat dark chocolate- or coffee-like but should never be burnt.

Clean lager character. Dry finish. Some residual sweetness is acceptable but not traditional. Aftertaste of hop bitterness with a complementary but subtle roastiness in the background.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium-light to medium body.

A complementary doughy, bready, or grainy wheat flavor is generally noticeable. Hop bitterness is undetectable; sourness provides the balance rather than hops. Never vinegary. Bright yet restrained fruitiness may be detected as apricot-peach, citrus-lemon, or tart apple. Very dry finish. Balance dominated by sourness, but some malt flavor should be present. No hop flavor. No THP.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Light body, but never thin. Very high carbonation. No sensation of alcohol. Crisp acidity.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Any Brett character is restrained, and is typically expressed as fruity and floral notes, not funky. Aged examples can show a cider, honey, hay, or gentle wildflower character, and sometimes increased acidity.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>A regional specialty of Berlin. Referred to by Napoleon’s troops in 1809 as “the Champagne of the North” due to its lively and elegant character. At one point, it was smoked and there used to be Märzen-strength (14 °P) version. Increasingly rare in Germany, but now produced in several other countries.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Pilsner malt. Usually wheat malt, often at least half the grist. A symbiotic co-fermentation with top-fermenting yeast and LAB provides the sharp sourness, which may be enhanced by blending of beers of different ages during fermentation and by cool aging. Decoction mashing with mash hopping is traditional. German brewing scientists believe that Brett is essential to get the correct, fruity-floral flavor profile.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Compared to Lambic, has a clean lactic sourness with restrained to below sensory threshold Brett.

Light sourness, slightly sharp. Noticeable coriander, which can have an aromatic lemony quality, and an intensity up to moderate. Light bready, doughy, yeasty character like uncooked sourdough bread. The acidity and coriander can give a bright, lively impression. The salt may be perceived as a very light, clean sea breeze character or just a general freshness, if noticeable at all.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Unfiltered, with a moderate to full haze.

Pronounced GOH-zeh.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Minor style associated with Leipzig but originating in the Middle Ages in the town of Goslar on the Gose River. Documented to have been in Leipzig by 1740. Leipzig was said to have 80 Gose houses in 1900. Production declined significantly after WWII, and ceased entirely in 1966. Modern production was revived in the 1980s in Germany, but the beer was not widely available. Became popular outside of Germany recently as a revival style, and is often used as a base style for fruited sour beers and other Specialty-Type beers.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Pilsner and wheat malt, restrained use of salt and coriander seed, Lacto.

The dry, tannic finish supports the suggestion of a vintage red wine.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Complex fruity-sour profile with supporting malt. Fruitiness is high, and reminiscent of black cherries, oranges, plums, red currants, or fruit leather. Low to medium-low vanilla, chocolate, or peppery phenol can be present for complexity. The sour aroma ranges from moderate to high. A dominant vinegary character is inappropriate, although low to moderate levels of acetic acid are acceptable if balanced with the malt. No hop aroma.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Deep red, burgundy to reddish-brown in color. Good clarity. White to very pale tan head. Average to good head retention.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Moderate to moderately-high malty flavors often have a soft toasty-rich quality. Intense fruit flavors, same descriptors as aroma. Complex, moderate to high sourness, accentuated by the esters; should not be a simple lactic sourness. A dominant vinegary character is inappropriate, although low to moderate acetic acid is acceptable if balanced with the malt. Generally as the sour character increases, the malt character fades to more of a background flavor (and vice versa). Low to medium-low vanilla, chocolate, or peppery phenols optional. No hop flavor. Restrained bitterness; balanced to the malt side. Acids and tannins can enhance the perception of bitterness, and provide balance and structure. Some versions are sweetened, or blended to be sweet; allow for a wide range of sweetness levels, which can soften the acidic bite and acetic perception.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium body, often enhanced by tannins. Low to medium carbonation. Low to medium astringency, often with a prickly acidity. Deceivingly light and crisp on the palate although a somewhat sweet finish is not uncommon.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>The “wine-like” observation should not be taken too literally; it may suggest a high-acid French Burgundy to some, but it is clearly not identical. Produced by long aging (up to two years) in large wooden vats (foeders), blending of young and well-aged beer, and variable amounts of sweetening of the final product. A wide range of products are possible depending on the actual blend and whether any sweetening takes place. Acetic flavors may be noted, but not all acidity in this beer is from acetic acid; vinegar is over six times greater in total acidity than this style. Fruited versions should be entered as a 29A Fruit Beer.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>An indigenous beer of West Flanders, typified by the products of the Rodenbach brewery, established in 1821. Aging in wooden vats and blending of old and young beers borrowed from the English tradition. Belgian brewers consider Flanders Red and Oud Bruin to be of the same style family, but the distinction was first made when Michael Jackson first defined beer styles, since the flavor profiles are distinctly different. Many modern examples are influenced by the popularity of Rodenbach Grand Cru.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Vienna or Munich malts, a variety of caramel malts, maize. Low alpha acid continental hops. Sacch, Lacto, and Brett. Aged in oak. Sometimes blended and sweetened (natural or artificial).</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Less malty-rich than an Oud Bruin, often with more of a fruity-tart and acetic profile.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.048</td><td>1.057</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>1.002</td><td>1.012</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>10</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>10</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>4.6</td><td>6.5</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>Cuvée des Jacobins</li><li>Duchesse de Bourgogne</li><li>New Belgium La Folie</li><li>Rodenbach Classic</li><li>Rodenbach Grand Cru</li><li>Vichtenaar Flemish Ale</li></ul><h2 id="Tags"><a href="#Tags" class="headerlink" title="Tags"></a>Tags</h2><ul><li>standard-strength</li><li>amber-color</li><li>top-fermented</li><li>western-europe</li><li>traditional-style</li><li>balanced</li><li>sour</li><li>wood</li></ul>]]></content>

Traditional versions are dry and tart, with an added fermented fruit flavor. Modern versions may have a variable sweetness, which can offset the acidity.

Has a low to high tart, puckering quality without being sharply astringent. Some versions have a light warming character. Carbonation can vary from sparkling to nearly still.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Produced like Gueuze, with the fruit commonly added halfway through aging, so the yeast and bacteria can ferment all sugars from the fruit; or less commonly by adding fruit to a Lambic. The variety of fruit can sometimes be hard to identify since fermented and aged fruit is often perceived differently than the more recognizable fresh fruit. Fruit can bring acidity and tannins, in addition to flavor and aroma; understanding the fermented character of added fruit helps with judging the style.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Same basic history as Gueuze, including the recent sweetening trend but with fruit in addition to sugar.

Belgian brewers consider Flanders Red and Oud Bruin to be of the same style family, but the distinction was first made when Michael Jackson first defined beer styles, since the flavor profiles are distinctly different.

Low alpha acid continental hops. Sacch and Lacto. Aged. Water with carbonates and magnesium typical of its home region.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>A deeper malt character with more caramel, toffee, and chocolate flavors and darker color distinguishes these beers from Flanders Red Ale. The Oud Bruin is less acetic and maltier than a Flanders Red, and the fruity flavors are more malt-oriented. In modern times, Oud Bruin also tends to be higher in alcohol than is typically seen in Flanders Red Ales.

The malt character is supportive, not robust and usually of the pale, lightly kilned varieties. Very low levels of pale crystal malts are allowed but roasted or strong chocolate character is always inappropriate. Bitterness is generally low and hop flavors can be low to non-existent. Mild tart notes, due to variety and amount of grape used, is common and may help to improve the digestibility but should not near ‘sour’ threshold.

Grape must (red or white varieties, typically fresh must) is usually 15 – 20% of the total grist, but can exceed 40%. The must is fermented with the beer, not a blending of wine and beer. Fruity-spicy yeast are most common but neutral varieties can be used. Hops should be selected to complement the overall profile. This beer is not dry-hopped. Oak is allowable, but not required, and it should not be overpowering, or at levels stronger than found in wine.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Similar base as several Belgian styles, like Belgian Blonde, Saison, and Belgian Single, but with grapes.

The fruit and spice character should each be evident but in balance with the beer, not so forward as to suggest an artificial product.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Varies by base style. The fruit and spice character should be noticeable in the aroma; however, note that some fruit and spices (e.g., raspberries, cherries, cinnamon, ginger) have stronger aromas and are more distinctive than others (e.g., blueberries, strawberries) – allow for a range of fruit and spice character and intensity from subtle to aggressive. Hop aroma may be lower than in the base style to better show the specialty character. The specialty ingredients should add an extra complexity, but not be so prominent as to unbalance the resulting presentation.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Varies by base style and special ingredients. Lighter-colored beer should show distinctive ingredient colors, including in the head. The color of fruit in beer is often lighter than the flesh of the fruit itself and may take on slightly different shades. Variable clarity, although haze is generally undesirable. Some ingredients may impact head retention.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Varies by base style. As with aroma, distinctive fruit and spice flavors should be noticeable, and may range in intensity from subtle to aggressive. The fruit character should not be so artificial or inappropriately overpowering as to suggest a spiced fruit juice drink. Hop bitterness, flavor, malt flavors, alcohol content, and fermentation byproducts, such as esters, should be appropriate to the base style, but be harmonious and balanced with the distinctive fruit and spice flavors present.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Varies by base style. Fruit often decreases body, and makes the beer seem lighter on the palate. Some smaller and darker fruits may add a tannic depth, but this astringency should not overwhelm the base beer. SHVs may increase or decrease body. Some SHVs may add a bit of astringency, although a “raw” spice character is undesirable.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>The description of the beer is critical for evaluation; judges should think more about the declared concept than trying to detect each individual ingredient. Balance, drinkability, and execution of the theme are the most important deciding factors.</p><h3 id="Entry-Instructions"><a href="#Entry-Instructions" class="headerlink" title="Entry Instructions"></a>Entry Instructions</h3><p>The entrant must specify the type of fruit, and the type of SHV used; individual SHV ingredients do not need to be specified if a well-known blend of spices is used (e.g., apple pie spice).

Light to moderate bready, doughy, or grainy wheat aroma. Light vanilla optional. Light floral, spicy, or herbal hops optional. Bubblegum (strawberry with banana), sourness, or smoke are faults.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Pale straw to gold in color. Very thick, moussy, long-lasting white head. Can be hazy and have a shine from wheat and yeast, although this can settle out in bottles.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Low to moderately strong banana and clove flavor, often well balanced. Low to moderate soft, somewhat bready, doughy, or grainy wheat flavor supported by the slight Pils malt grainy sweetness. Very low to moderately low bitterness. Well-rounded, flavorful palate with a relatively dry finish. Light vanilla optional. Very low floral, spicy, or herbal hop flavor optional. Any impression of sweetness is due more to low bitterness than any residual sweetness; a sweet or heavy finish impairs drinkability. Bubblegum, sourness, or smoke are faults. While the banana-and-clove profile is important, it should not be so strong as to be extreme and unbalanced.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium-light to medium body; never heavy. Fluffy, creamy fullness progressing to a light, spritzy finish aided by high to very high carbonation. Effervescent.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Also known as hefeweizen or weizenbier, particularly outside Bavaria. These beers are best enjoyed while young and fresh, as they often don’t age well. In Germany, lower-alcohol light (leicht) and non-alcoholic versions are popular. Kristall versions are filtered for brilliant clarity.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>While Bavaria has a wheat beer tradition dating back before the 1500s, brewing wheat beer used to be a monopoly reserved for Bavarian royalty. Modern Weissbier dates from 1872 when Schneider began production of its amber version. However, pale Weissbier only became popular since the 1960s (although the name historically could be used in Germany to describe beer made from air-dried malt, a different tradition). It is quite popular today, particularly in southern Germany.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Malted wheat, at least half the grist.

The style range includes Bock and Doppelbock strength, with variations for pale and dark color.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Medium-high to high malty richness with a significant bready, grainy wheat character. Medium-low to medium-high weizen yeast character, typically banana and clove. Vanilla accents optional. No hops. Low to moderate alcohol, not hot or solventy. The malt, yeast, and alcohol are well balanced, complex, and inviting. Bubblegum (strawberry with banana), sourness, or smoke are faults.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Very thick, moussy, long-lasting head.

Low to moderate banana and spice (clove, vanilla) yeast character. No hop flavor. Low to medium-low bitterness can give a slightly sweet palate impression, but the beer typically finishes dry. Light alcohol can enhance this character. The interplay between the malt, yeast, and alcohol adds complexity and interest, which is often enhanced with age. Bubblegum, sourness, or smoke are faults.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium-full to full body. Soft, smooth, fluffy or creamy texture. Mild alcohol warmth. Moderate to high carbonation.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>A Weissbier brewed to bock or doppelbock strength, although Schneider also produces an Eisbock version. Pale and dark versions exist, but dark is most common. Lightly oxidized Maillard products can produce some rich, intense flavors and aromas that are often seen in aged imported commercial products; fresher versions will not have this character. Well-aged examples might also take on a slight sherry-like complexity. Pale versions, like their doppelbock cousins, have less rich malt complexity and often more hop-forward. However, versions that have significant late hops or are dry-hopped should be entered in 34B Mixed-Style Beer.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Dopplebock-strength Aventinus was created in 1907 at the Schneider Weisse Brauhaus in Munich.

Highly carbonated and refreshing, with a creamy, fluffy texture and light finish.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Moderate esters and phenols, typically banana and clove, often well balanced with each other and with the malt. Light to moderate bready, doughy, or grainy wheat aroma, often accompanied by caramel, bread crust, or richer malt notes. Low to moderate vanilla optional. Light floral, spicy, or herbal hops optional. Bubblegum (strawberry with banana), sourness, or smoke are faults.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Light copper to dark, mahogany brown in color. Very thick, moussy, long-lasting off-white head. Can be hazy and have a shine from wheat and yeast, although this can settle out in bottled versions.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Low to moderately strong banana and clove flavor, often well balanced with each other and with the malt, although the malt may sometimes mask the clove impression. Low to medium-high soft, somewhat bready, doughy, or grainy wheat flavor with richer caramel, toast, or bread crust flavors. No strongly roasted flavors, but a touch of roasty dryness is allowable. Very low to low bitterness. Well-rounded, flavorful, often somewhat malty palate with a relatively dry finish. Very light to moderate vanilla optional. Low spicy, herbal, or floral hop flavor optional. Bubblegum, sourness, or smoke are faults.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium-light to medium-full body.

Increasingly rare and often being replaced by Kristall and non-alcoholic versions in Germany.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Bavaria has a wheat beer brewing traditional hundreds of years old, but the brewing right was reserved for Bavarian royalty until the late 1700s. Old-fashioned Bavarian wheat beer was often dark, as were most beers of the time. Pale Weissbier started to become popular in the 1960s, but traditional dark wheat beer remained somewhat of an old person’s drink.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Malted wheat, at least half the grist. Munich, Vienna, or Pilsner malt. Dark wheat, caramel wheat, or color malt. Decoction mash traditional. Weizen yeast, cool fermentation temperatures.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Combines the yeast and wheat character of Weissbier with the malty richness of a Munich Dunkel. The banana-and-clove character is often less apparent than in a Weissbier due to the increased maltiness. Has a similar yeast character as Roggenbier, but without the rye flavor and increased body.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.044</td><td>1.057</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>1.008</td><td>1.014</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>10</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>14</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>4.3</td><td>5.6</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>Ayinger Urweisse</li><li>Ettaler Benediktiner Weißbier Dunkel</li><li>Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse Dunkel</li><li>Hirsch Dunkel Weisse</li><li>Tucher Dunkles Hefe Weizen</li><li>Weihenstephaner Hefeweißbier Dunkel</li></ul><h2 id="Tags"><a href="#Tags" class="headerlink" title="Tags"></a>Tags</h2><ul><li>standard-strength</li><li>amber-color</li><li>top-fermented</li><li>central-europe</li><li>traditional-style</li><li>wheat-beer-family</li><li>malty</li></ul>]]></content>

May be a little richer, more robust, and rustic than the base styles. A fresh beer without fermentation defects associated with young, green (unfinished) beer.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Reflects base style.

May have an added bready, yeasty character from the yeast. Pale versions can have a more robust hop character. Dark versions can have a richer malt profile, but should never be roasty. May be slightly more bitter than the base style, and be a little heavier in the finish. Fully fermented with a clean fermentation profile; should not have eggy, buttery, apple-like, or similar flaws.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Reflects base style. May have a bit more body and a creamier texture than the base style. Carbonation typical of the base style, but may be lower.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>A traditional serving style more than a beer style, yet these beers do have sensory differences from the base beers. Judge these somewhat like Specialty-Type Beers; consider the range of kellerbiers based on Helles to Märzen to Dunkel to be a continuous spectrum, so allow the brewer to pick the closest one without being too picky about strict adherence to the base style.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Originally referred to lager beer matured in the caves or cellars under the brewery, and then served from them. First applied to amber lager from Franconia, then later to local Munich styles. More recently used internationally to create specialty Pils variants. By tradition, a serving style for a popular summer specialty in Bavaria, but now adapted broadly as a marketing term for unfiltered lagers.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Same as base styles. Traditionally naturally carbonated. Dry-hopping is not a traditional German brewing method, but some modern pale examples use this technique – which is allowable in this style as long as it is balanced. Traditionally lagered and unfiltered, these beers were never meant to be packaged for external sale.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Richer or more robust than the base style, possibly with a bit more body and mouthfeel.

Malt-forward in the balance.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Amber-orange to brown in color.

Generally light palate flavors typical of adjunct beers; a low grainy, corn-like sweetness is common. Medium to low floral or spicy hop flavor. Medium to low bitterness, no coarse or harsh aftertaste. May exhibit light fruitiness. Balance in the finish is towards the malt, possibly with a lightly flinty or minerally-sulfate flavor.

These stories are likely modern homebrewer inventions, theorizing that since local Bourbon distillers used a sour mash, beer brewers must also done so. No records indicate sour mashing or even a sour profile in the beer; rather the opposite, that it was brewed as an inexpensive, present-use ale. Enter soured versions in 28B Mixed-Fermentation Sour Beer.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>An American original, Kentucky Common was almost exclusively produced and sold around Louisville, Kentucky from some time after the Civil War until Prohibition. It was inexpensive and quickly produced, racked into barrels while actively fermenting, and tightly bunged to allow carbonation in the saloon cellar. Before the style died, it accounted for about 75% of sales around Louisville.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Six-row barley malt. Corn grits. Caramel and black malt. Rustic American bittering hops. Imported Continental finishing hops. High carbonate water.

Low to medium fruity esters, often dark fruit like plums. Very low earthy or floral hop aroma optional.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Medium to very dark brown color, but can be almost black. Nearly opaque, although should be relatively clear if visible. Low to moderate off-white to tan head.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Deep, caramel or toffee sweet malty flavor on the palate, lasting into the finish, often with hints of biscuit and coffee. Some dark fruit esters can be present; relatively clean fermentation profile for an English ale. Low bitterness. Low earthy or floral hop flavor optional, but rare. Moderately-low roasty or bitter black malt flavor optional. Moderately sweet finish with a smooth, malty aftertaste. May have a sugary-sweet flavor.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium body, but the residual sweetness may give a heavier impression. Medium-low to medium carbonation. Quite creamy and smooth in texture, particularly for its gravity.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Increasingly rare; Mann’s has over 90% market share in Britain, but in a vanishingly small segment. Always bottled. Frequently used as a sweet mixer with cask mild and bitter in pubs. Commercial versions can be pasteurized and back-sweetened, which gives more of a sugary-sweet flavor.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Developed by Mann’s as a bottled product in 1902. Claimed at the time to be “the sweetest beer in London.” Pre-WWI versions were around 5% ABV, but same general balance. Declined in popularity in second half of 20th century, and now nearly extinct.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>English pale ale malt as a base with a large proportion of darker caramel malts and often some black and wheat malts (this is Mann’s traditional grist – others can rely on dark sugars for color and flavor). Moderate to high carbonate water. English hops. Post-fermentation sweetening with lactose or artificial sweeteners, or sucrose, if pasteurized.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>May seem somewhat like a less roasty version of a Sweet Stout (and lower-gravity, at least for US sweet stout examples) or a sweet version of a Dark Mild.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.033</td><td>1.038</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>1.012</td><td>1.015</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>15</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>22</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>2.8</td><td>3.6</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>Harveys Bloomsbury Brown Ale</li><li>Mann’s Brown Ale</li></ul><h2 id="Tags"><a href="#Tags" class="headerlink" title="Tags"></a>Tags</h2><ul><li>session-strength</li><li>dark-color</li><li>top-fermented</li><li>british-isles</li><li>historical-style</li><li>brown-ale-family</li><li>malty</li><li>sweet</li></ul>]]></content>

Highly carbonated, dry, crisp, and refreshing.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Low to moderate oak wood smoke is the most prominent aroma component, but can be subtle and hard to detect. A low spicy, herbal, or floral hop aroma is typically present, and should be lower than or equal to the smoke in intensity. Hints of grainy wheat are also detected in the best examples. The aroma is otherwise clean, although light pome fruit esters (especially ripe red apple or pear) are welcome. No acidity. Light sulfur optional.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Pale yellow to gold in color with excellent clarity. A tall, billowy, white, tightly-knit head with excellent retention is distinctive. Murkiness is a fault.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Moderately-low to medium oak smoke flavor up front which carries into the finish; the smoke can be stronger in flavor than in aroma. The smoke character is gentle, should not be acrid, and can lend an impression of sweetness. A moderate to strong bitterness is readily evident which lingers through the finish. The overall balance is toward bitterness. Low but perceptible spicy, herbal, or floral hop flavor. Low grainy wheat character in the background. Light pome fruit esters (red apple or pear) may be present. Dry, crisp finish. No sourness.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Light in body, with a crisp and dry finish. Carbonation is quite high and can add a slight carbonic bite or prickly sensation. No alcohol warmth.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Pronounced in English as “pivo grow-JEES-kee-uh” (meaning: Grodzisk beer). Known as Grätzer (pronounced “GRATE-sir”) in German-speaking countries, and in some beer literature. Traditionally made using a multi-step mash, a long boil (~2 hours), and multiple strains of ale yeast. The beer is never filtered but Isinglass is used to clarify before bottle conditioning. Traditionally served in tall conical glassware to accommodate the vigorous foam stand.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Developed as a unique style centuries ago in the Polish city of Grodzisk (known as Grätz when ruled by Prussia and Germany). Its fame and popularity rapidly extended to other parts of the world in the late 19th and early 20th century. Regular commercial production declined after WWII and ceased in the 1990s. This style description describes the traditional version during its period of greatest popularity.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Oak-smoked wheat malt, which has a less intense smoke character than German Rauchmalz, and a drier, crisper, leaner quality – a smoky bacon or ham flavor is inappropriate. Traditional Polish, Czech or German hops. Moderate hardness sulfate water. Clean, attenuative ale yeast; Weizen yeast inappropriate.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Similar in strength to a Berliner Weisse, but never sour and much more bitter. Has a smoked character but less intense than in a Rauchbier. Lower gravity than a Lichtenhainer, but more bitter and not sour.

Low to moderate banana-and-clove weizen yeast character, although the balance can vary. Medium-dry, grainy finish with a lightly bitter (from rye) aftertaste. Low to moderate spicy, herbal, or floral hop flavor acceptable, and can persist into aftertaste.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium to medium-full body.

Rye has been characterized as having the most assertive flavor of all cereal grains. It is inappropriate to add caraway seeds, as some American brewers do; the spicy rye character is traditionally from the rye grain only.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>A specialty German rye beer originally brewed in Regensburg, Bavaria in 1988 by Schierlinger.

This does not imply that English IPAs aren’t proper IPAs or that there isn’t a relationship between them. This is simply a method of grouping similar styles for competition purposes. English IPAs are grouped with other English-derived beers, and the stronger Double IPA is grouped with stronger American beers. The term “IPA” is intentionally not spelled out as “India Pale Ale” since none of these beers historically went to India, and many aren’t pale. However, the term IPA has come to be a balance-defined style in modern craft beer.</em></p><h2 id="Guidelines"><a href="#Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines"></a>Guidelines</h2><h3 id="Impression"><a href="#Impression" class="headerlink" title="Impression"></a>Impression</h3><p>An American IPA with intense fruit flavors and aromas, a soft body, smooth mouthfeel, and often opaque with substantial haze. Less perceived bitterness than traditional IPAs but always massively hop-forward.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Intense hop aroma, with stone fruit, tropical fruit, citrus, or other fruity qualities; not grassy or herbal. Clean, neutral, grainy, or lightly bready malt in the background; no caramel or toast. Absence of any malt character is a fault. Neutral to fruity fermentation character. Esters from yeast and hops should not clash. A creamy, buttery, or acidic aroma is inappropriate. Light alcohol aroma optional.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Color ranging from straw to very light amber, sometimes with an orange hue. Hazy, often opaque, clarity; should not be cloudy or murky. The opacity can add a ‘shine’ to the beer and make the color seem darker. Any visible floating hop matter, yeast clumps, or other particulates is a fault. Medium to rocky, meringue-like white head with high to very high retention.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>High to very high fruity hop flavor, same descriptors as aroma. Low to medium malt flavor, same descriptors as aroma. Low to medium-high perceived bitterness, often masked by the fuller body and soft, off-dry to medium finish. The hop character in the aftertaste should not be sharp or harsh. Neutral to fruity fermentation profile, supportive of the hops. Should not be sweet, although high ester levels and lower bitterness may sometimes give that impression. Background alcohol flavor optional.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium to medium-full body. Medium carbonation. Smooth. No harshness. Light warmth optional. The beer should not have a creamy or viscous mouthfeel, an acidic twang, or a raw starch texture.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Also known as New England IPA or NEIPA. An emphasis on late hopping, especially dry-hopping, with hops with tropical fruit qualities lends the ‘juicy’ character for which this style is known.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>A modern craft beer style originating in the New England region of the United States as an American IPA variant. Alchemist Heady Topper is believed to be the original inspiration as the style grew in popularity during the 2010s. The style continues to evolve, including a trend towards lower bitterness and using the style as the base for other additions.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Grist like an American IPA, but with more flaked grains and less caramel or specialty malts. American or New World hops with fruity characteristics. Neutral to estery yeast. Balanced to chloride-rich water. Heavily dry-hopped, partly during active fermentation, using a variety of hopping doses and temperatures to emphasis depth of hop aroma and flavor over bitterness.

Compared to English IPA, has less caramel, bread, and toast; often more American or New World hops; fewer yeast-derived esters; less body and often a more hoppy balance; and is slightly stronger than most examples.

This does not imply that English IPAs aren’t proper IPAs or that there isn’t a relationship between them. This is simply a method of grouping similar styles for competition purposes. English IPAs are grouped with other English-derived beers, and the stronger Double IPA is grouped with stronger American beers. The term “IPA” is intentionally not spelled out as “India Pale Ale” since none of these beers historically went to India, and many aren’t pale. However, the term IPA has come to be a balance-defined style in modern craft beer.</em></p><h2 id="Guidelines"><a href="#Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines"></a>Guidelines</h2><h3 id="Impression"><a href="#Impression" class="headerlink" title="Impression"></a>Impression</h3><p>A very pale, hop-forward American IPA variant with a bone-dry finish, very high carbonation, and a restrained bitterness level. Can be suggestive of a sparkling white wine or Champagne. The hop character is modern, and emphasizes flavor and aroma dimensions.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Moderately high to intense hop aroma, very bright and hop-forward in the balance. Modern American and New World hop varieties provide a wide range of possible characteristics, such as tropical, stone fruit, citrusy, or white grape, but not grassy, vegetal, or herbal. Malt is subtle, neutral, and in the background, but never caramelly or overly corny-sweet. A light, clean alcohol note is optional. Very clean fermentation character; should not be yeasty.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Very pale color, ranging from very pale straw to very light gold. Crystal clear but a touch of haze is acceptable. High to very high carbonation gives a massive, rocky, billowy, white head with tight, persistent bubbles.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>High to very high hop flavor, same descriptors as aroma. Low to very low neutral malt character, subtle in the balance. No strong malt flavors, no caramel. Perceived bitterness is low to very low due to the bone-dry finish and very high carbonation. Neutral to slightly fruity fermentation profile. No diacetyl. Dry to very dry finish with a fresh, hoppy aftertaste, and a clean bitterness.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Light to very light body with a spritzy carbonation (high to very high), reminiscent of a sparkling white wine. No bitter, harsh, hop-derived astringency. Alcohol warmth may be present but should never be hot.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Original concept was a sparkling wine-like IPA, although the hop character now varies more widely. Very low final gravity and high carbonation makes balance critical, often requiring a surprisingly low measured bitterness. ‘Brut’ is a wine term indicating dryness. Used incorrectly, added enzymes can cause diacetyl, which is always a flaw.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>A modern craft beer style originating in 2017 at the (now closed) Social Kitchen &amp; Brewery in San Francisco as a west coast reaction to the rising trend of east coast hazy and juicy IPAs as well as thick and sweet so-called milkshake IPAs. The style is still evolving and changing (and perhaps dying, as the beer was quite faddish in 2018-2019 in the US). Most versions seem to be morphing into low-calorie IPAs.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Pilsner or very pale base malts with up to 40% adjuncts. No crystal malt or lactose. Enzymes, such as amyloglucosidase. Highly aromatic, oil-heavy, modern American or New World hops used in a variety of late-hopping or post-boil procedures to emphasize hop aroma and flavor and to minimize bitterness. Neutral yeast.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Less malt flavor, bitterness, and color than an American IPA, and much drier and more highly carbonated. Dry-hopped like an American IPA. Similar aroma and flavor as a Hazy IPA but without sweetness and with much less haze. Very pale, highly carbonated, and dry like a Belgian Golden Strong Ale but not as strong and without Belgian yeast character.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.046</td><td>1.057</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>0.990</td><td>1.004</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>20</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>6.0</td><td>7.5</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>Drake’s Brightside Extra Brut IPA</li><li>Fair State Brewing Co-Op The Brut Squad</li><li>Ommegang Brut IPA</li></ul><h2 id="Tags"><a href="#Tags" class="headerlink" title="Tags"></a>Tags</h2><ul><li>high-strength</li><li>pale-color</li><li>top-fermented</li><li>north-america</li><li>craft-style</li><li>ipa-family</li><li>specialty-family</li><li>bitter</li><li>hoppy</li></ul>]]></content>

This does not imply that English IPAs aren’t proper IPAs or that there isn’t a relationship between them. This is simply a method of grouping similar styles for competition purposes. English IPAs are grouped with other English-derived beers, and the stronger Double IPA is grouped with stronger American beers. The term “IPA” is intentionally not spelled out as “India Pale Ale” since none of these beers historically went to India, and many aren’t pale. However, the term IPA has come to be a balance-defined style in modern craft beer.</em></p><h2 id="Guidelines"><a href="#Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines"></a>Guidelines</h2><h3 id="Impression"><a href="#Impression" class="headerlink" title="Impression"></a>Impression</h3><p>Recognizable as an IPA by balance – a hop-forward, bitter, dryish beer – with something else present to distinguish it from the standard categories. Should have good drinkability, regardless of the form. Excessive harshness and heaviness are typically faults, as are strong flavor clashes between the hops and the other specialty ingredients.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Detectable hop aroma is required; characterization of hops is dependent on the specific type of Specialty IPA. Other aromatics may be present; hop aroma is typically the strongest element.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Color depends on specific type of Specialty IPA. Most should be clear, but a slight haze is acceptable in most styles. Darker types can be opaque, making clarity irrelevant. Good, persistent head stand with color dependent on the specific type of Specialty IPA.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Variable by type, with the quality of each component dependent on the specific Specialty IPA. Hop flavor typically medium-low to high. Hop bitterness typically medium-high to very high. Malt flavor generally low to medium. Commonly has a medium-dry to dry finish. Some clean alcohol flavor can be noted in stronger versions. Various types of Specialty IPAs can show additional malt and yeast characteristics, depending on the type.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Smooth. Medium-light to medium body. Medium carbonation, generally. A background alcohol warmth can be perceived in stronger versions.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Entrants may use this category for a different strength version of an IPA defined by its own BJCP subcategory (e.g., session-strength American or English IPA) – except where an existing BJCP subcategory already exists for that style (e.g., double [American] IPA). A Session IPA is a 21B Specialty IPA with a base style of 21A American IPA with Session strength. A Double IPA is Category 22A not 21B.</p><h3 id="Entry-Instructions"><a href="#Entry-Instructions" class="headerlink" title="Entry Instructions"></a>Entry Instructions</h3><p>Entrant must specify a strength (session, standard, double); if no strength is specified, standard will be assumed. Entrant must specify specific type of Specialty IPA from the list of Currently Defined Types identified in the Style Guidelines, or as amended by Provisional Styles on the BJCP website; OR the entrant must describe the type of Specialty IPA and its key characteristics in comment form so judges will know what to expect.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><p>Variable by type, see individual styles</p>]]></content>

The balance can range from fairly even to quite bitter, with the more balanced versions having a little malty sweetness and the bitter versions being quite dry. Draught versions typically are creamy from a nitro pour, but bottled versions will not have this dispense-derived character. The roasted flavor can range from dry and coffee-like to somewhat chocolaty.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Moderate coffee-like aroma typically dominates; may have slight dark chocolate, cocoa, or roasted grain secondary notes. Medium-low esters optional. Low earthy or floral hop aroma optional.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Jet black to deep brown with garnet highlights in color. According to Guinness, “Guinness beer may appear black, but it is actually a very dark shade of ruby.” Opaque.

The finish can be dry and coffee-like to moderately balanced with a touch of caramel or malty sweetness. Typically has coffee-like flavors, but also may have a bittersweet or unsweetened chocolate character in the palate, lasting into the finish. Balancing factors may include some creaminess, medium-low fruitiness, or medium earthy hop flavor.

Low to moderate carbonation. For the high hop bitterness and significant proportion of dark grains present, this beer is remarkably smooth.

Modern examples are almost always associated with a nitro pour. Do not expect bottled beers to have the full, creamy texture or very long-lasting head associated with mixed-gas dispense. Regional differences exist in Ireland, similar to variability in English Bitters. Dublin-type stouts use roasted barley, are more bitter, and are drier. Cork-type stouts are sweeter, less bitter, and have flavors from chocolate and specialty malts.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>The style evolved from London porters, but reflecting a fuller, creamier, more “stout” body and strength. Guinness began brewing only porter in 1799, and a “stouter kind of porter” around 1810. Irish stout diverged from London single stout (or simply porter) in the late 1800s, with an emphasis on darker malts and roast barley. Guinness began using flaked barley after WWII, and Guinness Draught was launched as a brand in 1959.

Very few such institutions actually brew today, although many have licensed their names to commercial breweries. Despite the limited production, the traditional styles derived from these breweries have been quite influential and have spread beyond Belgium.<br>Various terms have been used to describe these beers, but many are protected appellations and reflect the origin of the beer rather than a style. Those monasteries could brew any style they choose, but the ones described in this category are those that are most commonly associated with this brewing tradition.<br>We differentiate beers in this category as those that were inspired by religious breweries. Despite claims of uniqueness, these beers do share a number of common attributes that help characterize the styles. All are top-fermenting, have very high attenuation (“more digestible” in Belgium), achieve high carbonation through bottle conditioning (“refermented in the bottle” in Belgium), and have distinctive, complex, and aggressive ‘Belgian’ spicy-estery yeast character. Many are strong in alcohol.</em></p><h2 id="Guidelines"><a href="#Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines"></a>Guidelines</h2><h3 id="Impression"><a href="#Impression" class="headerlink" title="Impression"></a>Impression</h3><p>A dark, complex, very strong Belgian ale with a delicious blend of malt richness, dark fruit flavors, and spicy notes. Complex, rich, smooth, and dangerous.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>A complex and fairly intense mix of rich maltiness and deep fruit, accentuated by spicy phenols and alcohol. The malt character is moderately-high to high and has a deep, bready-toasty base with dark caramel notes, but no impression of dark or roasted malt. Esters are strong to moderately low, and reminiscent of raisins, plums, dried cherries, figs, dates, or prunes. Spicy phenols like black pepper or vanilla, not clove, may be present as a low to moderate background character. A soft, spicy, perfumy, or rose-like alcohol is low to moderate, but never hot or solvent-like. Hops are usually not noticeable, but if present can add a light spicy, floral, or herbal character.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Deep amber to deep coppery-brown in color (dark in the style name implies more deeply colored than golden, not black). Huge, dense, moussy, persistent cream- to light tan-colored head. Usually clear.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Rich and complex maltiness, but not heavy in the finish. The flavor character is similar to the aroma (same malt, ester, phenol, alcohol, and hop comments apply here as well). Moderately malty-rich on the palate, which can have a sweet impression if bitterness is low. Usually moderately dry to dry finish, although may be up to moderately sweet. Medium-low to moderate bitterness; alcohol provides some of the balance to the malt. Generally malty-rich balance, but can be fairly even with bitterness. The complex and varied flavors should blend smoothly and harmoniously, and often benefit from age. The finish should not be heavy or syrupy.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>High carbonation but not sharp. Smooth but noticeable alcohol warmth. Body can range from medium-light to medium-full and creamy. Most are medium-bodied.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Also known as a Belgian Quad, mainly outside of Belgium (Quadruple is the name of a specific beer). Has a wider range of interpretation than many other Belgian styles. Traditional versions tend to be drier than many modern commercial versions, which can be rather sweet and full-bodied. Many examples are simply known by their strength or color designation. Some might be labeled Grand Cru, but this is more of a statement of quality than style.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Westvleteren started making their version just before World War II, with Chimay and Rochefort adding their examples just after. Other monastic breweries created products towards the end of the 20th century, but some secular breweries began producing similar beers starting around 1960.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Spicy-estery Belgian yeast. Impression of a complex grain bill, although many traditional versions are quite simple, with caramelized sugar syrup or unrefined sugars and yeast providing much of the complexity. Continental hops. Spices not typical; if present, should be subtle.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Like a larger Belgian Dubbel, with a fuller body and increased malt richness. Not as bitter or hoppy as a Belgian Tripel, but of similar strength.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.075</td><td>1.110</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>1.010</td><td>1.024</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>20</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>12</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>8.0</td><td>12.0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>Achel Extra Bruin</li><li>Boulevard The Sixth Glass</li><li>Chimay Blue</li><li>Rochefort 10</li><li>St. Bernardus Abt 12</li><li>Westvleteren 12</li></ul><h2 id="Tags"><a href="#Tags" class="headerlink" title="Tags"></a>Tags</h2><ul><li>very-high-strength</li><li>amber-color</li><li>top-fermented</li><li>western-europe</li><li>traditional-style</li><li>malty</li></ul>]]></content>

Never roasted or burnt. Moderate fruity esters, often dark or dried fruit, especially raisins and plums, sometimes pome fruit or banana. Low to moderate spicy, peppery phenols. Hops typically absent, but can have a low spicy, herbal, or floral character. The malt is strongest in the balance, with esters and spice adding complexity. Low soft, perfumy alcohol optional.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Dark amber to copper in color, with an attractive reddish depth of color.

Low to medium-low malt backdrop, with bready, crackery, grainy, or light honey notes. Fruit expression can vary widely (apple, pear, grapefruit, lemon, orange, peach, apricot).

Medium-high to high carbonation, can be somewhat prickly.

Highly attenuated, generally 85% or more.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>While monastic breweries have a tradition of brewing a lower-strength beer as a monk’s daily ration (Westmalle began making theirs in 1922), the bitter, pale beer this style describes is a relatively modern invention reflecting current tastes.

Has less sweetness, higher attenuation, less character malt, and is more hop-centered than a Belgian Pale Ale.

Quite aromatic, with spicy, fruity, and light alcohol notes combining with the supportive clean malt character to produce a surprisingly drinkable beverage considering the high alcohol content.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Complex but seamless bouquet of moderate to significant spiciness, moderate fruity esters, low alcohol, low hops, and light malt. Generous spicy, peppery, sometimes clove-like phenols. Esters often reminiscent of citrus fruit, like oranges or lemons, but may sometimes have a slight ripe banana character. A low yet distinctive spicy, floral, sometimes perfumy hop character is optional. Alcohols are soft, spicy, and low in intensity. The malt character is light, with a soft, slightly grainy-sweet, or slightly honey-like impression.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Deep yellow to pale amber in color.

Esters low to moderate, phenols low to moderate, hops low to moderate, alcohol low, all well combined in a coherent presentation. Medium to high bitterness, accentuated by a dry finish. Moderate bitterness in the aftertaste with substantial spicy-fruity yeast character. Should not be sweet.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium-light to medium body, although lighter than the substantial gravity would suggest. Highly carbonated. The alcohol content is deceptive, and has little to no obvious warming sensation. Effervescent. Should not be heavy.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>High in alcohol but does not taste strongly of alcohol.

The clean hop presence can reflect classic or modern American or New World hop varieties with a wide range of characteristics.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Moderate to moderately-high hop aroma from American or New World hop varieties with a wide range of possible characteristics, including citrus, floral, pine, resin, spice, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, or melon. None of these specific characteristics are required, but a hoppy aroma should be apparent. Low to moderate neutral to grainy maltiness supports the hop presentation, and can show low amounts of specialty malt character (e.g., bread, toast, biscuit, caramel). Fruity esters optional, up to moderate in strength. Fresh dry-hop aroma optional.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Pale golden to amber.

Caramel flavors are often absent or fairly restrained, but are acceptable as long as they don’t clash with the hops. Moderate to high bitterness. Clean fermentation profile. Fruity yeast esters can be moderate to none, although many hop varieties are quite fruity. Medium to dry finish. The balance is typically towards the late hops and bitterness; the malt presence should be supportive, not distracting.

There can be some overlap in color between American Pale Ale and American Amber Ale. The American Pale Ale will generally be cleaner, have a less caramelly malt profile, less body, and often more finishing hops. Less bitterness in the balance and alcohol strength than an American IPA.

Freshness makes a huge difference with this beer, as the delicate character can fade quickly with age.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Low to very low grainy-sweet malt aroma. A subtle fruit aroma (apple, pear, or sometimes cherry) is optional, but welcome. Low floral, spicy, or herbal hop aroma optional.

Low to moderately-high floral, spicy, or herbal hop flavor; most are medium-low to medium. May have a neutral-grainy to light malty sweet impression at the start. Soft, rounded palate. Finish is soft, dry, and slightly crisp, not sharp or biting. No noticeable residual sweetness. While the balance between the flavor components can vary, none are ever strong.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium-light to medium body; most are medium-light.

Köln breweries differentiate themselves through balance, so allow for a range of variation within the style when judging. Drier versions may seem hoppier or more bitter than the IBU levels might suggest. The delicate flavor profile does not age well, so be alert for oxidation defects. Served in Köln in a tall, narrow 20cl glass called a Stange.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Köln has a top-fermenting brewing tradition since the Middle Ages, but the beer now known as Kölsch was developed in the late 1800s as an alternative to pale lagers. Bottom fermentation was actually prohibited in Cologne. Kölsch is an appellation protected by the Kölsch Konvention (1986), and is restricted to breweries in and around Köln. The Konvention simply defines the beer as a “light, highly attenuated, hop-accentuated, clear, top-fermenting Vollbier.”</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Traditional German hops.

Hops and malt can fade with age, but the beer should always have a bitter balance.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium-light body. Medium to high carbonation. Should not feel heavy. Not harsh, but may have a flinty, minerally, sharpness in some examples.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Modern examples of Pils tend to become paler in color, drier and sharper in finish, and more bitter moving from South to North in Germany, often mirroring increasing sulfates in the water. Pils found in Bavaria tend to be a bit softer in bitterness with more malt flavor and late hop character, yet still with sufficient hops and crispness of finish to differentiate itself from Munich Helles. The use of the term ‘Pils’ is more common in Germany than ‘Pilsner’ to differentiate it from the Czech style, and (some say) to show respect.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Adapted from Czech Pilsner to suit brewing conditions in Germany, particularly water with higher mineral content and domestic hop varieties. First brewed in Germany in the early 1870s. Became more popular after WWII as German brewing schools emphasized modern techniques. Along with its cousin Czech Pilsner, it is the ancestor of the most widely produced beer styles today.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Continental Pilsner malt.

Fairly bitter, with a moderate herbal-spicy hop and pome fruit ester profile. Smooth, neutral malt flavors with a fuller body but a crisp, highly-attenuated finish.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Fairly soft, clean aroma with a balanced mix of esters, hops, malt, and yeast – all moderate to low in intensity. The esters are frequently pears and apples, optionally with a very light touch of banana. The hops are earthy, herbaceous, or might show the characteristic iron-like Pride of Ringwood nose. The malt can range from neutral grainy to moderately sweet to lightly bready; no caramel should be evident. Very fresh examples can have a lightly yeasty, sulfury nose.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Deep yellow to light amber in color, often medium gold. Tall, frothy, persistent white head with tiny bubbles. Noticeable effervescence due to high carbonation. Brilliant clarity if decanted, but typically poured with yeast to have a cloudy appearance. Not typically cloudy unless yeast roused during the pour.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Medium to low rounded, grainy to bready malt flavor, initially mild to malty-sweet but a medium to medium-high bitterness rises mid-palate to balance the malt. Caramel flavors typically absent. Highly attenuated, giving a dry, crisp finish with lingering bitterness, although the body gives an impression of fullness. Medium to medium-high hop flavor, somewhat earthy and possibly herbal, resinous, peppery, or iron-like but not floral, lasting into aftertaste. Medium-high to medium-low esters, often pears and apples. Banana is optional, but should never dominate. May be lightly minerally or sulfury, especially if yeast is present. Should not be bland.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>High to very high carbonation, giving mouth-filling bubbles and a crisp, spritzy carbonic bite. Medium to medium-full body, tending to the higher side if poured with yeast. Smooth but gassy. Stronger versions may have a light alcohol warmth, but lower alcohol versions will not. Very well-attenuated; should not have any residual sweetness.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Coopers has been making their flagship Sparkling Ale since 1862, although the formulation has changed over the years. Presently the beer will have brilliant clarity if decanted, but publicans often pour most of the beer into a glass then swirl the bottle and dump in all the yeast. In some bars, the bottle is rolled along the bar. When served on draught, the brewery instructs publicans to invert the keg to rouse the yeast. A cloudy appearance for the style seems to be a modern consumer preference. Always naturally carbonated, even in the keg. A present-use ale, best enjoyed fresh.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Brewing records show that the majority of Australian beer brewed in the 19th century was draught XXX (Mild) and porter. Ale in bottle was originally developed to compete with imported bottled pale ales from British breweries, such as Bass and Wm Younger’ Monk. By the early 20th century, bottled pale ale went out of fashion and “lighter” lager beers were in vogue. Many Australian Sparkling and Pale Ales were labeled as ales, but were actually bottom-fermented lagers with very similar grists to the ales that they replaced. Coopers of Adelaide, South Australia is the only surviving brewer producing the Sparkling Ale style.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Lightly kilned Australian 2-row pale malt, lager varieties may be used. Small amounts of crystal malt for color adjustment only. Modern examples use no adjuncts, cane sugar for priming only. Historical examples using 45% 2 row, 30% higher protein malt (6 row) would use around 25% sugar to dilute the nitrogen content. Traditionally used Australian hops, Cluster, and Goldings until replaced from mid-1960s by Pride of Ringwood. Highly attenuative Burton-type yeast (Australian-type strain typical). Variable water profile, typically with low carbonate and moderate sulfate.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Superficially similar to English Pale Ales, although much more highly carbonated, with less caramel, less late hops, and showcasing the signature yeast strain and hop variety. More bitter than IBUs might suggest due to high attenuation, low final gravity, and somewhat coarse hops.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.038</td><td>1.050</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>1.004</td><td>1.006</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>20</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>4</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>4.5</td><td>6.0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>Coopers Sparkling Ale</li></ul><h2 id="Tags"><a href="#Tags" class="headerlink" title="Tags"></a>Tags</h2><ul><li>standard-strength</li><li>pale-color</li><li>top-fermented</li><li>pacific</li><li>traditional-style</li><li>pale-ale-family</li><li>bitter</li></ul>]]></content>

Drinkability and a refreshing quality are critical components of the style, as it was initially a summer seasonal beer.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Hop aroma is moderately low to moderately high, and can use any variety of hops – floral, herbal, or earthy English hops and citrusy American hops are most common. Frequently a single hop varietal will be showcased. Low bready malt aroma with no caramel. Medium-low to low fruity aroma from the hops rather than esters. Low diacetyl optional.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Straw to golden in color. Good to brilliant clarity. Low to moderate white head.

Hop flavor is moderate to moderately high of any hop variety, although citrus flavors are increasingly common. Medium-low to low malt character, generally bready with perhaps a little biscuity flavor. Caramel flavors are typically absent. Hop bitterness and flavor should be pronounced. Moderately-low to low esters. Medium-dry to dry finish. Bitterness increases with alcohol level, but is always balanced. Low diacetyl optional.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Light to medium body. Low to moderate carbonation on draught, although bottled commercial versions will be higher. Stronger versions may have a slight alcohol warmth, but this character should not be too high.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Well-hopped, quenching beer with an emphasis on showcasing hops. Served colder than traditional bitters, this style was originally positioned as a refreshing summer beer, but is now often brewed year-round. Once brewed with English hops, increasingly American citrus-flavored hops are used. Golden Ales are also called Golden Bitters, Summer Ales, or British Blonde Ales. Can be found in cask, keg, and bottle.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Modern golden ales were developed in England to take on strongly-marketed lagers. While it is difficult to identify the first, Hop Back’s Summer Lightning, first brewed in 1986, is thought by many to have got the style off the ground.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Low-color pale or lager malt acting as a blank canvas for the hop character. May use sugar adjuncts, corn, or wheat. English hops frequently used, although citrusy American varietals are becoming more common. Somewhat clean-fermenting British yeast.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>More similar to an American Pale Ale than anything else, although it is often lower in alcohol and usually features British ingredients. Has no caramel and fewer esters compared to British Bitters and pale ales. Dry as Bitters but with less malt character to support the hops, giving a different balance. Often uses (and features) American hops, more so than most other modern British styles.

Medium carbonation. Alcohol strength barely noticeable as warming, if at all.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>This style represents the modern German beer served at Oktoberfest (although it is not solely reserved for Oktoberfest; it can be found at many other ‘fests’), and is sometimes called Wiesn (“the meadow” or local name for the Oktoberfest festival). We chose to call this style Festbier since by German and EU regulations, Oktoberfestbier is a protected appellation for beer produced at large breweries within the Munich city limits for consumption at Oktoberfest. Other countries are not bound by these rules, so many craft breweries in the US produce beer called Oktoberfest, but based on the traditional style described in these guidelines as Märzen. May be called Helles Märzen.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Since 1990, the majority of beer served at Oktoberfest in Munich has been this style. Export beer specifically made for the United States is still mainly of the traditional amber style, as are US-produced interpretations. Paulaner first created the golden version in the mid-1970s because they thought the traditional Oktoberfest was too filling. So they developed a lighter, more drinkable but still malty version that they wanted to be “more poundable” (according to the head brewer at Paulaner). But the actual type of beer served at Oktoberfest is set by a Munich city committee.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Majority Pils malt, but with some Vienna or Munich malt to increase maltiness. Differences in commercial examples are mostly due to different maltsters and yeast, not major grist differences.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Less intense and less richly toasted than a Märzen. Stronger than a Munich Helles, with a bit more body, and hop and malt flavor. Less rich in malt intensity than a Helles Bock. The malt complexity is similar to a higher-gravity Czech Premium Pale Lager, although without the associated hops.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.054</td><td>1.057</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>1.010</td><td>1.012</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>18</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>5.8</td><td>6.3</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>Augustiner Oktoberfest</li><li>Hacker-Pschorr Superior Festbier</li><li>Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier</li><li>Löwenbräu Oktoberfestbier</li><li>Paulaner Oktoberfest Bier</li><li>Weihenstephaner Festbier</li></ul><h2 id="Tags"><a href="#Tags" class="headerlink" title="Tags"></a>Tags</h2><ul><li>standard-strength</li><li>pale-color</li><li>bottom-fermented</li><li>lagered</li><li>central-europe</li><li>traditional-style</li><li>pale-lager-family</li><li>malty</li></ul>]]></content>

Finish is medium-dry to very dry, and the bitterness may linger into the aftertaste but should not be harsh. The balance is toward the hops, but the malt should still be noticeable in support.

The 60&#x2F;- Scottish Light is rare and often cask-only, but it does seem to be having a bit of a renaissance currently. All these styles took modern form after World War II, regardless of prior use of the same names. Currently, the 60&#x2F;- is similar to a dark mild, the 70&#x2F;- is similar to an ordinary bitter, and the 80&#x2F;- similar to a best or strong bitter. The Scottish beers have a different balance and flavor profile, but fill a similar market position as those English beers. The Light, Heavy, and Export beers have similar flavor profiles, and are often produced through the parti-gyling process. As gravity increases, so does the character of the beer. Traditional ingredients were dextrinous pale ale malt, corn, dark brewing sugars, and brewers caramel for coloring. Modern (post-WWII) recipes often add small amounts of dark malt and lower percentages of crystal malt, along with other ingredients like amber malt and wheat. Scottish brewers traditionally used single infusion mashes, often with underlet mashes and multiple sparges. In general, these Scottish beers are weaker, sweeter, darker, lower in attenuation, and less highly hopped compared to equivalent modern English beers. They are produced using slightly cooler fermentation temperatures than their counterparts. Many of these differences have been exaggerated in popular lore; they are noticeable, but not huge, yet enough to affect the balance of the beer, and to perhaps indicate a national flavor preference. The balance remains malty and somewhat sweet due to higher finishing gravity, lower alcohol, and lower hopping rates. Many of these divergences from English beer took place between the late 1800s and the mid-1900s. Production methods championed by homebrewers, such as kettle caramelization or grists heavy in a variety of crystal malts, are not commonly used in traditional products but can approximate those flavors when traditional ingredients aren’t available. The use of peat-smoked malt is not only completely inauthentic, it produces a dirty, phenolic flavor inappropriate in any of these styles. Smoked versions (using any type smoke) should be entered in 32A Classic Style Smoked Beer. The use of ‘shilling’ (&#x2F;-) designations is a Scottish curiosity. Originally it referred to the price of beer in hogshead casks, which in no way could be constant over time. Shillings aren’t even used as a currency now in Scotland. But the name stuck as a shorthand for a type of beer, even if the original meaning stopped being the real price during WWI. About all it means now is that larger numbers mean stronger beers, at least within the same brewery. Between the world wars, some breweries used the price per pint rather than shillings (e.g., Maclay 6d for 60&#x2F;-, 7d for 70&#x2F;-, 8d for 80&#x2F;-). Confusingly, during this time 90&#x2F;- pale ale was a low-gravity bottled beer.

In general, these Scottish beers are weaker, sweeter, darker, lower in attenuation, and less highly hopped compared to equivalent modern English beers. They are produced using slightly cooler fermentation temperatures than their counterparts. Many of these differences have been exaggerated in popular lore; they are noticeable, but not huge, yet enough to affect the balance of the beer, and to perhaps indicate a national flavor preference. The balance remains malty and somewhat sweet due to higher finishing gravity, lower alcohol, and lower hopping rates. Many of these divergences from English beer took place between the late 1800s and the mid-1900s. Production methods championed by homebrewers, such as kettle caramelization or grists heavy in a variety of crystal malts, are not commonly used in traditional products but can approximate those flavors when traditional ingredients aren’t available. The use of peat-smoked malt is not only completely inauthentic, it produces a dirty, phenolic flavor inappropriate in any of these styles. Smoked versions (using any type smoke) should be entered in 32A Classic Style Smoked Beer. The use of ‘shilling’ (&#x2F;-) designations is a Scottish curiosity. Originally it referred to the price of beer in hogshead casks, which in no way could be constant over time. Shillings aren’t even used as a currency now in Scotland. But the name stuck as a shorthand for a type of beer, even if the original meaning stopped being the real price during WWI. About all it means now is that larger numbers mean stronger beers, at least within the same brewery. Between the world wars, some breweries used the price per pint rather than shillings (e.g., Maclay 6d for 60&#x2F;-, 7d for 70&#x2F;-, 8d for 80&#x2F;-). Confusingly, during this time 90&#x2F;- pale ale was a low-gravity bottled beer.

The 60&#x2F;- Scottish Light is rare and often cask-only, but it does seem to be having a bit of a renaissance currently. All these styles took modern form after World War II, regardless of prior use of the same names. Currently, the 60&#x2F;- is similar to a dark mild, the 70&#x2F;- is similar to an ordinary bitter, and the 80&#x2F;- similar to a best or strong bitter. The Scottish beers have a different balance and flavor profile, but fill a similar market position as those English beers. The Light, Heavy, and Export beers have similar flavor profiles, and are often produced through the parti-gyling process. As gravity increases, so does the character of the beer. Traditional ingredients were dextrinous pale ale malt, corn, dark brewing sugars, and brewers caramel for coloring. Modern (post-WWII) recipes often add small amounts of dark malt and lower percentages of crystal malt, along with other ingredients like amber malt and wheat. Scottish brewers traditionally used single infusion mashes, often with underlet mashes and multiple sparges. In general, these Scottish beers are weaker, sweeter, darker, lower in attenuation, and less highly hopped compared to equivalent modern English beers. They are produced using slightly cooler fermentation temperatures than their counterparts.

Evergreen wood should never be used since it adds a medicinal, piney flavor to the malt. Noticeable peat-smoked malt is universally undesirable due to its sharp, piercing phenols and dirt-like earthiness. The remaining ingredients vary with the base style.

In general, spices are the dried seeds, seed pods, fruit, roots, bark, etc. of plants used for flavoring food. Herbs are leafy plants or parts of plants (leaves, flowers, petals, stalks) used for flavoring food. Vegetables are savory or less sweet edible plant products, used primarily for cooking or sometimes eating raw. Vegetables can include some botanical fruit. This category explicitly includes all culinary spices, herbs, and vegetables, as well as nuts (or anything with ‘nut’ in the name, including coconut), chile peppers, coffee, chocolate, spruce tips, rose hips, hibiscus, fruit peels&#x2F;zest (but not juice), rhubarb, and the like. It does not include culinary fruit or grains. Flavorful fermentable sugars and syrups (e.g., agave nectar, maple syrup, molasses, sorghum, treacle, honey) or sweeteners (e.g., lactose) can be included only in combination with other allowable ingredients, and should not have a dominant character. Any combination of allowable ingredients may also be entered.<br>See Category 29 for a definition and examples of fruit. See the Introduction to Specialty-Type Beer section for additional comments, particularly on evaluating the balance of added ingredients with the base beer.</em></p><h2 id="Guidelines"><a href="#Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines"></a>Guidelines</h2><h3 id="Impression"><a href="#Impression" class="headerlink" title="Impression"></a>Impression</h3><p>An appealing fusion of spices, herbs, or vegetables (SHVs) and beer, but still recognizable as beer.

The SHV character should be noticeable in the aroma; however, some SHVs (e.g., ginger, cinnamon, rosemary) have stronger aromas and are more distinctive than others (e.g., most vegetables) – allow for a range of SHV character and intensity from subtle to aggressive. Hop aroma may be lower than in the base style to better show the SHV character. The SHVs should add an extra complexity, but not be so prominent as to unbalance the resulting presentation.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Varies by base style and special ingredients. Lighter-colored beer may show distinctive ingredient colors, including in the head. Variable clarity, although haze is generally undesirable.

As with aroma, distinctive SHV flavors should be noticeable, and may range in intensity from subtle to aggressive. Some SHVs are inherently bitter and may result in a beer more bitter than the declared base style. Bitterness, hop and malt flavors, alcohol content, and fermentation byproducts, such as esters, should be appropriate for the base style, but be harmonious and balanced with the distinctive SHV flavors present.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Varies by base style. SHVs may increase or decrease body. Some SHVs may add a bit of astringency, although a “raw” spice character is undesirable.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>The description of the beer is critical for evaluation; judges should think more about the declared concept than trying to detect each individual ingredient. Balance, drinkability, and execution of the theme are the most important deciding factors.</p><h3 id="Entry-Instructions"><a href="#Entry-Instructions" class="headerlink" title="Entry Instructions"></a>Entry Instructions</h3><p>The entrant must specify the type of spices, herbs, or vegetables used, but individual ingredients do not need to be specified if a well-known spice blend is used (e.g., apple pie spice, curry powder, chili powder).

The category is defined mostly by higher alcohol strength and a lack of roast.</em></p><h2 id="Guidelines"><a href="#Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines"></a>Guidelines</h2><h3 id="Impression"><a href="#Impression" class="headerlink" title="Impression"></a>Impression</h3><p>A very strong, malty, hoppy, bitter American ale with a rich palate, full mouthfeel, and warming aftertaste, suitable for contemplative sipping.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Strong malt and hop aroma dominates. Hops are moderate to assertive, showing a range of American, New World, or English characteristics. Citrusy, fruity, or resiny are classic attributes, but others are possible, including those from modern hops. Strong grainy, bready, toasty, light caramel, or neutral malt richness, but typically not with darker caramel, roast, or deep fruit aspects. Low to moderately strong esters and alcohol, lower in the balance than the malt and hops. Intensities fade with age.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Color ranges from amber to medium copper, rarely up to light brown. Ruby highlights common. Moderately-low to large off-white to light tan head; may have low head retention. Good to brilliant clarity but may have some chill haze. The color may appear to have great depth, as if viewed through a thick glass lens. Legs possible.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Similar malt and hop flavors as the aroma (same descriptors apply). Moderately strong to aggressive bitterness, tempered by a rich, malty palate. Moderate to high hop flavor. Low to moderate esters. Noticeable alcohol, but not solventy. Moderately low to moderately high malty sweetness on the palate, with a somewhat malty to dry but full finish. Age will often dry out the beer, and smooth out the flavors. The balance is malty, but always bitter.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Full-bodied and chewy, with a velvety, luscious texture, declining with age. A smooth alcohol warmth should be noticeable, but shouldn’t burn. Carbonation may be low to moderate, depending on age and conditioning.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Sometimes labeled as “Barley Wine” or “Barleywine-style ale”. Recently many US breweries seem to have discontinued their Barleywines, made them barrel-aged, or rebranded them as some form of IPA.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Traditionally the strongest ale offered by a brewery, often associated with the winter season and vintage-dated. As with many American craft beer styles, an adaptation of an English style using American ingredients and balance. One of the first American craft beer versions was Anchor Old Foghorn, first brewed in 1975. Sierra Nevada Bigfoot, first brewed in 1983, set the standard for the hop-forward style of today. The story goes that when Sierra Nevada first sent Bigfoot out for lab analysis, the lab called and said, “your Barleywine is too bitter” – to which Sierra Nevada replied, “thank you.”</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Pale malt with some specialty malts. Dark malts used with great restraint. Many varieties of hops can be used, but typically includes American hops. American or English ale yeast.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Greater emphasis on hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma than English Barley Wine, often featuring American hop varieties. Typically paler than the darker English Barley Wines and lacking their deeper malt flavors, but darker than the golden English Barley Wines. Differs from a Double IPA in that the hops are not extreme, the malt is more forward, and the body is fuller and often richer. American Barleywine typically has more residual sweetness than Double IPA, which affects the overall drinkability (sipping vs. drinking).</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.080</td><td>1.120</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>1.016</td><td>1.030</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>50</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>9</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>8.0</td><td>12.0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>Anchor Old Foghorn</li><li>Bell’s Third Coast Old Ale</li><li>East End Gratitude</li><li>Hair of the Dog Doggie Claws</li><li>Sierra Nevada Bigfoot</li></ul><h2 id="Tags"><a href="#Tags" class="headerlink" title="Tags"></a>Tags</h2><ul><li>very-high-strength</li><li>amber-color</li><li>top-fermented</li><li>north-america</li><li>craft-style</li><li>strong-ale-family</li><li>bitter</li><li>hoppy</li></ul>]]></content>

The malty and hoppy flavors can be quite strong, but are generally in balance.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Medium to high hop aroma typically featuring modern American or New World hop characteristics such as citrus, floral, pine, resinous, spicy, tropical fruit, stone fruit, berry, or melon. Moderate to bold maltiness supporting the hop profile, with medium to dark caramel common, toasty or bready possible, and background notes of light roast or chocolate allowable. Neutral to moderately fruity fermentation profile. Alcohol may be noted, but should not be solventy.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Medium amber to deep copper or light brown.

Moderate to high hop flavor, same descriptors as aroma. Low to moderate esters. May have a noticeable alcohol flavor, but should not be sharp. Medium to high malty sweetness on the palate, finishing somewhat dry to somewhat sweet. Should not be syrupy, sweet, or cloying. Bitter to bittersweet aftertaste, with hops, malt, and alcohol noticeable.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium to full body. An alcohol warmth may be present, but should not be excessively hot. Light hop astringency allowable.

Diverse enough to include what may be viewed as a strong American Amber Ale with room for stronger versions of other American Ale styles.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>While modern craft versions were developed as “imperial” strength versions of American amber or red ales, the style has much in common with historic American Stock Ales. Strong, malty beers were highly hopped to keep as provision beers prior to Prohibition.

Medium to dark crystal malts common. American or New World hops. Neutral or lightly fruity yeast.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Generally not as strong and as rich as an American Barleywine.

Moderate to moderately-strong bready, wheaty malt character, often with additional malt complexity such as honey and caramel. A light, clean, alcohol aroma may be noted.

Low to moderate toasty, caramel, biscuity, or honey malt notes can add a welcome complexity, but are not required. Low to medium hop flavor, reflecting any variety. Moderate to moderately-high fruitiness, often with a dried-fruit character. Low to moderate bitterness, creating a malty to even balance.

Complex and delicate, the dry finish, light body, and high carbonation accentuate the yeast and hop character. Sparkling carbonation and effervescent, forming a rocky white head.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>A complex bouquet of fruity esters, herbal hops, and peppery alcohol over a nearly neutral malt base. The esters are moderate to high, often pome fruit, especially pear. Hops are herbal, floral, or spicy, low to moderate. Alcohol and phenols often have a peppery or perfumy quality, low to moderate. Alcohol perception should be soft, not hot or solventy. Nearly neutral malt, possibly slightly grainy-sweet.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Pale yellow to gold in color.

Subtle to moderate yeast profile featuring fruity-citrusy esters (like oranges or lemons), and background spicy-peppery phenols. Light earthy or spicy hop notes optional.

Covers the style space above bitters, milds, and brown ales while excluding porters and stouts.</em></p><h2 id="Guidelines"><a href="#Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines"></a>Guidelines</h2><h3 id="Impression"><a href="#Impression" class="headerlink" title="Impression"></a>Impression</h3><p>A stronger-than-average English ale, though usually not as strong or rich as an English Barley Wine, but usually malty. Warming. Shows positive maturation effects of a well-kept, aged beer.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Malty-sweet with fruity esters, often with a complex blend of dried fruit, vinous, caramel, molasses, toffee, light treacle, or other specialty malt aromas. Some alcohol and nutty oxidative notes are acceptable, akin to those found in Sherry, Port, or Madeira. Hop aroma not usually present.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Deep amber to very dark reddish-brown color, but most are fairly dark. Age and oxidation may darken the beer further. Clear, but can be almost opaque. Moderate to low cream- to light tan-colored head; retention average to poor.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Medium to high malt character with a luscious malt complexity, often with nut, caramel, or molasses-like flavors. Light chocolate or roasted malt flavors are optional, but should never be prominent. Balance is often malty-sweet, but may be well hopped; the impression of bitterness often depends on amount of aging. Moderate to high fruity esters are common, and may take on a dried-fruit or vinous character. The finish may vary from dry to somewhat sweet. Extended aging may contribute oxidative flavors similar to a fine old Sherry, Port, or Madeira. Alcoholic strength should be evident, though not overwhelming. Low diacetyl optional.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium to full, chewy body, although older examples may be lower in body due to continued attenuation during conditioning. Alcohol warmth is often evident and always welcome. Low to moderate carbonation, depending on age and conditioning. Light acidity may be present, as well as some tannin if wood-aged; both are optional.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Strength and character vary widely. The predominant defining quality for this style is the impression of age, which can manifest itself in different ways (complexity, oxidation, leather, vinous qualities, etc.). Many of these qualities are otherwise faults, but if the resulting character of the beer is pleasantly drinkable and complex, then those characteristics are acceptable. In no way should those allowable characteristics be interpreted as making an undrinkably off-flavored beer as somehow in style. Old Peculier is a well-known but fairly unique beer that is quite different than other Old Ales.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Historically, an aged ale used as stock ales for blending or enjoyed at full strength (stale or stock refers to beers that were aged or stored for a significant period of time). There are at least two definite types in Britain today, weaker, unaged draught ones that are similar to milds of around 4.5%, and stronger aged ones that are often 6-8% or more.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Composition varies, although generally similar to British Strong Ales. The age character is the biggest driver of the final style profile, which is more handling than brewing.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Roughly overlapping the British Strong Ale and the lower end of the English Barley Wine styles, but always having an aged quality. The distinction between an Old Ale and a Barley Wine is somewhat arbitrary above 7% ABV, and generally means having a more significant aged quality.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.055</td><td>1.088</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>1.015</td><td>1.022</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>30</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>10</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>5.5</td><td>9.0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>Avery Old Jubilation</li><li>Berlina Old Ale</li><li>Greene King Strong Suffolk Ale</li><li>Marston Owd Roger</li><li>Theakston Old Peculier</li></ul><h2 id="Tags"><a href="#Tags" class="headerlink" title="Tags"></a>Tags</h2><ul><li>high-strength</li><li>amber-color</li><li>top-fermented</li><li>british-isles</li><li>traditional-style</li><li>strong-ale-family</li><li>malty</li><li>aged</li></ul>]]></content>

Characterized by a fruity, spicy, sometimes phenolic fermentation profile, and the use of cereal grains and sometimes spices for complexity. Several variations in strength and color exist.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>A pleasantly aromatic mix of fruity-spicy yeast and hops. The fruity esters are moderate to high, and often have a citrus fruit, pome fruit, or stone fruit character. Low to moderately-high spicy notes are often like black pepper, not clove. Hops are low to moderate and have a continental character (spicy, floral, earthy, or fruity). The malt is often overshadowed, but if detected is lightly grainy. Spices and herbs optional, but must not dominate. Sourness optional (see Comments).</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Pale gold to deep amber in color, sometimes pale orange. Long-lasting, dense, rocky white to ivory head. Belgian lace. Unfiltered, so clarity is variable (poor to good) and may be hazy. Effervescent.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>A balance of fruity and spicy yeast, hoppy bitterness, and grainy malt with moderate to high bitterness, and a very dry finish. The fruity and spicy aspects are medium-low to medium-high, and hop flavor is low to medium, both with similar character as in the aroma (same descriptors apply). Malt is low to medium, with a soft, grainy palate. Very high attenuation, never with a sweet or heavy finish. Bitter, spicy aftertaste. Spices and herbs optional, but if used must be in harmony with the yeast. Sourness optional (see Comments).</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Light to medium-low body. Very high carbonation. Effervescent. Light warming alcohol optional. Sourness rare but optional (see Comments).</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>This style generally describes the standard- strength pale version, followed by differences for variations in strength and color. Darker versions tend to have more malt character and less apparent hop bitterness, yielding a more balanced presentation. Stronger versions often have more malt flavor, richness, warmth, and body simply due to the higher gravity. There is no correlation between strength and color. Sourness is totally optional, and if present at low to moderate levels, it may substitute somewhat for bitterness in the balance. A Saison should not be both sour and bitter at the same time. The high attenuation may make the beer seem more bitter than the IBUs suggest. Pale versions are often more bitter and hoppy than darker versions. Yeast selection often drives the balance of fruity and spicy notes, and can change the character significantly; allow for a range of interpretations. Often called Farmhouse ales in the US, but this term is not common in Europe where they are simply part of a larger grouping of artisanal ales. Brettanomyces is not typical for this style; Saisons with Brett should be entered in the 28A Brett Beer style. A Grisette is a well-known type of Saison popular with miners; enter Grisette as 25B Saison, Session Strength, Comment: Grisette with wheat as the character grain.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>A provision ale from Wallonia, the French-speaking part of Belgium. Originally a lower-alcohol product so as to not debilitate farm and field workers, but tavern-strength products also existed. The best known modern saison, Saison Dupont, was first produced in the 1920s. Dupont’s super saison was first produced in 1954, and its brown version in the mid-1980s. Fantôme begain producing its ‘seasonal’ saisons in 1988. While the style retains its rustic image, they are now mostly made in large breweries.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Pale base malt. Cereal grains, such as wheat, oats, spelt, or rye. May contain sugary adjuncts. Continental hops. Spicy-fruity Belgian Saison yeast. Spices and herbs are uncommon, but allowable if they don’t dominate.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>The pale, standard strength versions is like a more highly-attenuated, hoppy, and bitter Belgian Blond Ale with a stronger yeast character. At super strength and pale color, similar to a Belgian Tripel, but often with more of a grainy, rustic quality and sometimes with a spicier yeast character.</p><h3 id="Entry-Instructions"><a href="#Entry-Instructions" class="headerlink" title="Entry Instructions"></a>Entry Instructions</h3><p>The entrant must specify the strength (table, standard, super) and the color (pale, dark).

A wide range of supportive caramelized sugar and toasty bread type aromas are possible (toasted breadcrumbs, ladyfingers, English biscuits, graham crackers, nougat, butterscotch, etc.). Faint hint of roast is sometimes noted. Low to moderate dark or dried fruit esters and alcohol. Very low earthy, floral, orange-citrus, or spicy hops optional.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Light copper to dark brown color, often with deep ruby highlights.

The malt often has caramelized sugar and toasty flavors of the same type as described in the aroma. Medium to low alcohol and esters (plums, raisins, dried fruit, etc.).

Can have a wide range of interpretations, but most will have varying degrees of malty richness, late hops and bitterness, fruity esters, and alcohol warmth. The malt and adjunct flavors and intensity can vary widely, but any combination should result in an agreeable palate experience.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Malty-sweet with fruity esters, often with a complex blend of dried-fruit, caramel, nuts, toffee, or other specialty malt aromas. Some alcohol notes are acceptable, but shouldn’t be hot or solventy. Hop aromas can vary widely, but typically have earthy, resiny, fruity, or floral notes. The balance can vary widely, but most examples will have a blend of malt, fruit, hops, and alcohol in varying intensities.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Amber to dark reddish-brown color; many are fairly dark. Generally clear, although darker versions may be almost opaque. Moderate to low cream- to light tan-colored head with average retention.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Medium to high malt character often rich with nutty, toffee, or caramel flavors. Light chocolate notes are sometimes found in darker beers. May have interesting flavor complexity from brewing sugars. Balance is often malty, but may be well hopped, which affects the impression of maltiness. Moderate fruity esters are common, often with a dark fruit or dried fruit character. The finish may vary from medium dry to somewhat sweet. Alcoholic strength should be evident, not overwhelming. Low diacetyl optional, but generally not desirable.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium to full, chewy body. Alcohol warmth is often evident and always welcome. Low to moderate carbonation. Smooth texture.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>An entry category more than a style; the strength and character of examples can vary widely. Fits in the style space between normal gravity beers and Barley Wines. Can include pale malty-hoppy beers, English winter warmers, strong dark milds, smaller Burton ales, and other unique beers in the general gravity range that don’t fit other categories. Judges should allow for a significant range in character, as long as the beer is within the alcohol strength range and has an interesting ‘British’ character, it likely fits the style.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>A collection of unrelated minor styles, each of which has its own heritage. Do not use this category grouping to infer a historical relationship between examples – none is intended. This is a modern British specialty judging category where the ‘special’ attribute is alcohol level.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Grists vary, often based on pale malt with caramel and specialty malts. Some darker examples suggest a light use of dark malts (e.g., chocolate, black malt). Sugary and starchy adjuncts (e.g., maize, flaked barley, wheat) are common. Finishing hops are traditionally English.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Significant overlap in gravity with Old Ale, but not having an aged character. A wide range of interpretations is possible. Should not be as rich or strong as an English Barley Wine. Stronger than the stronger everyday Strong Bitter, British Brown Ale, and English Porter. More specialty malt or sugar character than American Strong Ale.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.055</td><td>1.080</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>1.015</td><td>1.022</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>30</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>8</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>5.5</td><td>8.0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>Fuller’s 1845</li><li>Harvey’s Elizabethan Ale</li><li>J.W.

A wintertime sipper with a full, chewy body and warming alcohol.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Very rich, strongly malty, often with a caramel-like aroma in darker versions or a light toffee character in paler versions. May have a rich character including bready, toasty, or toffee notes. May have moderate to strong fruitiness, often with a dark- or dried-fruit character, particularly in dark versions. The hop aroma may range from mild to assertive, and is typically floral, earthy, tea-like, or marmalade-like. Alcohol may be low to moderate, but are soft and rounded. Aromatic intensity subsides with age, and can develop a quality like sherry, wine, or port.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Color ranging from golden amber to dark brown, often with ruby highlights and significant depth of color. Should not be black or opaque. Low to moderate off-white head. May have low head retention. Brilliant clarity, particularly when aged, although younger versions can have a little haze. High alcohol and viscosity may be visible as legs.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Medium to high rich, malty sweetness, often complex and multi-layered, with bread, biscuit, and caramel malt flavors (more toffee-like in paler versions) and having a medium to high fruitiness (often with dark or dried fruit aspects). When aged, these fruity components come out more, and darker versions will have a higher level than paler ones. The hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness can vary wildly. Light to strong hops, with an English character (floral, earthy, tea, or marmalade-like) are common. Bitterness can be light to fairly strong, fading with time, so the balance can be malty to somewhat bitter. Stronger versions will have a little alcohol character. The finish and aftertaste can be moderately dry to moderately sweet, often depending on age. Aged versions may develop complex oxidative or vinous flavors at a noticeable but not prominent level. Pale versions typically seem more bitter, better attenuated, and more hop-forward than darker versions.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Full-bodied and chewy, with a velvety, luscious texture, declining with age. A smooth warmth from aged alcohol should be present, but shouldn’t burn. Carbonation may be low to moderate, depending on age and conditioning.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>The richest and strongest of modern English Ales. Their character can change significantly over time; both young and old versions should be appreciated for what they are. The malt profile can vary widely; not all examples will have all possible flavors or aromas. Paler varieties won’t have the caramel and richer malt flavors, nor will they typically have the darker dried fruits – don’t expect flavors and aromatics that are impossible from a beer of that color. Typically written as “Barley Wine” in the UK, and “Barleywine” in the US.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>A modern descendent of the strongest Burton Ales. Bass No. 1 was first called a barley wine in 1872. Traditionally a darker beer until Tennant (now Whitbread) first produced Gold Label, a gold-colored version in 1951. The original style that inspired derivative variations in Belgium, the United States, and elsewhere in the world.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>British pale ale and crystal malts. Limited use of dark malts. Often uses brewing sugars. English hops. British yeast.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Less hoppy and bitter, maltier and fruitier than American Barleywine. Can overlap Old Ale on the lower end of the range, but without heavier signs of age. Not as caramelly and often not as sweet as a Wee Heavy.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.080</td><td>1.120</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>1.018</td><td>1.030</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>35</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>8</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>8.0</td><td>12.0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>Burton Bridge Thomas Sykes Old Ale</li><li>Coniston No. 9 Barley Wine</li><li>Fuller’s Golden Pride</li><li>Hogs Back A over T</li><li>J.W.

Most are dark, but some pale versions are known.</em></p><h2 id="Guidelines"><a href="#Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines"></a>Guidelines</h2><h3 id="Impression"><a href="#Impression" class="headerlink" title="Impression"></a>Impression</h3><p>A strong, dark, malty beer with different interpretations within the Baltic region. Smooth, warming, and richly malty, with complex dark fruit flavors and a roasted flavor without burnt notes.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Rich maltiness often containing caramel, toffee, nuts, deep toast, or licorice notes. Complex alcohol and ester profile of moderate strength, and reminiscent of plums, prunes, raisins, cherries, or currants, occasionally with a vinous Port-like quality. Deep malt accents of dark chocolate, coffee, or molasses, but never burnt. No hops. No sourness. Smooth, not sharp, impression.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Dark reddish-copper to opaque dark brown color, but not black. Thick, persistent tan-colored head. Clear, although darker versions can be opaque.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>As with aroma, has a rich maltiness with a complex blend of deep malt, dried fruit esters, and alcohol. The malt can have a caramel, toffee, nutty, molasses, or licorice complexity. Prominent yet smooth Schwarzbier-like roasted flavor that stops short of burnt. Light hints of black currants and dark dried fruits. Smooth palate and full finish. Starts malty-sweet but darker malt flavors quickly dominate and persist through the dryish finish, leaving a hint of roast coffee or licorice and dried fruit in the aftertaste. Medium-low to medium bitterness, just to provide balance and prevent it from seeming cloying. Hop flavor from slightly spicy hops ranges from none to medium-low. Clean fermentation profile.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Generally quite full-bodied and smooth, with a well-aged alcohol warmth that can be deceptive. Medium to medium-high carbonation, making it seem even more mouth-filling. Not heavy on the tongue due to carbonation level.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Most commercial versions are in the 7–8.5% ABV range. The best examples have a deceptive strength that makes them dangerously easy to drink. The character of these beers varies by country of origin, so be careful about generalizing based on a single example. Some beers are truer to their English roots, while others are more of the style first popularized in Poland.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Developed indigenously (and independently) in several countries bordering the Baltic Sea after import of popular English porters and stouts was interrupted in the early 1800s. Historically top-fermented, many breweries adapted the recipes for bottom-fermenting yeast along with the rest of their production. The name Baltic Porter is recent (since the 1990s) and describes the modern collection of beers with a somewhat similar profile from these countries, not historical versions.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Generally lager yeast (cold fermented if using ale yeast, as is required when brewed in Russia). Debittered dark malt. Munich or Vienna base malt. Continental hops. May contain crystal malts or adjuncts. Brown or amber malt common in historical recipes. As a collection of regional beers, different formulations are expected.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Combines the body, maltiness, richness, and smoothness of a Doppelbock, the darker malt character of an English Porter, the roast flavors of a Schwarzbier, and alcohol and fruitiness of and Old Ale.

Even though flavors are concentrated, the alcohol should be smooth and warming, not burning.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Dominated by rich, intense malt and a definite alcohol presence. The malt can have bready, toasty, qualities, with some caramel or faint chocolate, often with dark fruit notes like plums or grapes. No hop aroma. Alcohol aromas should not be harsh or solventy. Clean fermentation profile.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Deep copper to dark brown in color, often with attractive ruby highlights. Good clarity. Head retention may be moderate to poor. Off-white to deep ivory colored head. Pronounced legs are often evident.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Rich, sweet malt balanced by a significant alcohol presence. The malt can have Maillard products, toasty qualities, some caramel, and occasionally a slight chocolate flavor. May have significant malt-derived dark fruit esters. Hop bitterness just offsets the malt sweetness enough to avoid a cloying character. No hop flavor. Alcohol helps balance the strong malt presence. The finish should be of rich malt with a certain dryness from the alcohol. It should not be sticky, syrupy, or cloyingly sweet. Clean fermentation profile.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Full to very full-bodied. Low carbonation. Significant alcohol warmth without sharp hotness. Very smooth and silky without harsh edges from alcohol, bitterness, fusels, or other concentrated flavors.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Extended lagering is often needed post-freezing to smooth the alcohol and enhance the malt and alcohol balance. Pronounced “ICE-bock.”</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Originating in Kulmbach in Franconia in the late 1800s, although exact origins are not known. Fables describe it as coming from beer accidentally freezing at a brewery.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Same as Doppelbock. Produced by freezing a doppelbock-like beer and removing ice (“freeze distillation”), thus concentrating flavor and alcohol, as well as any defects present. Commercial eisbocks are generally concentrated anywhere from 7% to 33% by volume.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>Eisbocks are not simply stronger Doppelbocks; the name refers to the process of freezing and concentrating the beer, and is not a statement on alcohol; some Doppelbocks are stronger than Eisbocks. Not as thick, rich, or sweet as a Wheatwine.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.078</td><td>1.120</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>1.020</td><td>1.035</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>25</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>17</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>9.0</td><td>14.0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>Kulmbacher Eisbock</li></ul><h2 id="Tags"><a href="#Tags" class="headerlink" title="Tags"></a>Tags</h2><ul><li>very-high-strength</li><li>amber-color</li><li>bottom-fermented</li><li>lagered</li><li>central-europe</li><li>traditional-style</li><li>bock-family</li><li>malty</li></ul>]]></content>

The darker versions have more richly-developed, deeper malt flavors, while the paler versions have slightly more hops and dryness.</p><h3 id="Aroma"><a href="#Aroma" class="headerlink" title="Aroma"></a>Aroma</h3><p>Very strong maltiness, possibly with light caramel notes, and up to a moderate alcohol aroma. Virtually no hop aroma.</p><h3 id="Appearance"><a href="#Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h3><p>Good clarity, with a large, creamy, persistent head.</p><h3 id="Flavor"><a href="#Flavor" class="headerlink" title="Flavor"></a>Flavor</h3><p>Very rich and malty. Hop bitterness varies from moderate to moderately low but always allows malt to dominate the flavor. Faint hop flavor optional. Most examples are fairly malty-sweet on the palate, but should have an impression of attenuation in the finish. The impression of sweetness comes from low hopping, not from incomplete fermentation. Clean fermentation profile.</p><h3 id="Mouth-Feel"><a href="#Mouth-Feel" class="headerlink" title="Mouth Feel"></a>Mouth Feel</h3><p>Medium-full to full body. Moderate to moderately-low carbonation. Very smooth without harshness, astringency. A light alcohol warmth may be noted, but it should never burn.</p><h3 id="Comments"><a href="#Comments" class="headerlink" title="Comments"></a>Comments</h3><p>Doppelbock means double bock. Most versions are dark colored and may display the caramelizing and Maillard products of decoction mashing, but excellent pale versions also exist. The pale versions will not have the same richness and darker malt and fruit flavors of the dark versions, and may be a bit drier, hoppier, and more bitter. While most traditional examples are in the lower end of the ranges cited, the style can be considered to have no upper limit for gravity and alcohol, provided the balance remains the same.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>A Bavarian specialty originating in Munich, first made by the monks of St. Francis of Paula by the 1700s. Historical versions were less well-attenuated than modern interpretations, thus with higher sweetness and lower alcohol levels. Was called “liquid bread” by monks, and consumed during the Lenten fast. Breweries adopted beer names ending in “-ator” after a 19th century court ruling that no one but Paulaner was allowed to use the name Salvator. Traditionally dark brown in color; paler examples are a more recent development.</p><h3 id="Ingredients"><a href="#Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients"></a>Ingredients</h3><p>Pils, Vienna, Munich malts. Occasionally dark malt for color adjustment. Traditional German hops. Clean German lager yeast. Decoction mashing is traditional.</p><h3 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h3><p>A stronger, richer, more full-bodied version of either a Dunkles Bock or a Helles Bock. Pale versions will show higher attenuation and less dark fruity character than the darker versions.</p><h3 id="Entry-Instructions"><a href="#Entry-Instructions" class="headerlink" title="Entry Instructions"></a>Entry Instructions</h3><p>The entrant will specify whether the entry is a pale or a dark variant.</p><h3 id="Statistics"><a href="#Statistics" class="headerlink" title="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Min</th><th>Max</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OG</td><td>1.072</td><td>1.112</td></tr><tr><td>FG</td><td>1.016</td><td>1.024</td></tr><tr><td>IBU</td><td>16</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>SRM</td><td>6</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>ABV</td><td>7.0</td><td>10.0</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Commercial-Examples"><a href="#Commercial-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Commercial Examples"></a>Commercial Examples</h2><ul><li>Andechs Doppelbock Dunkel (dark)</li><li>Ayinger Celebrator (dark)</li><li>Paulaner Salvator (dark)</li><li>Spaten Optimator (dark)</li><li>Tröegs Troegenator (dark)</li><li>Weihenstephaner Korbinian (dark)</li><li>Eggenberg Urbock 23º (pale)</li><li>Meinel Doppelbock Hell (pale)</li><li>Plank Bavarian Heller Doppelbock (pale)</li><li>Riegele Auris 19 (pale)</li><li>Schönbuch Doppelbock Hell (pale)</li><li>Staffelberg-Bräu Zwergator (pale)</li></ul><h2 id="Tags"><a href="#Tags" class="headerlink" title="Tags"></a>Tags</h2><ul><li>high-strength</li><li>amber-color</li><li>pale-color</li><li>bottom-fermented</li><li>lagered</li><li>central-europe</li><li>traditional-style</li><li>bock-family</li><li>malty</li></ul>]]></content>
